[[Blockqueuedjobplugin-﻿Description]]
== ﻿Description

Plugin for blocking/unblocking job in queue by some conditions
configured in this job.

*Features*

Built in conditions:

* Block job when last build of defined target project is in building
status
* Block job when last build of defined target project has result

Note: conditions has *waterfall priority* so if "unblock" conditions get
matching first - job will be unblocked, if not - then next condition
will be verified.
