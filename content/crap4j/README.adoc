[.conf-macro .output-inline]#This plugin reads the "crappy methods"
report from http://crap4j.org/[Crap4J]. Jenkins will generate the trend
report of crap percentage and provide detailed information about
changes.# Users will be able to track which methods are crappy and when
they entered and left the code base. +

[[Crap4JPlugin-ConfiguringtheCrap4JPlugin]]
== Configuring the Crap4J Plugin

. Get the
https://hudson.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=9231&expandFolder=9231&folderID=5818[crap4j
plugin], preferably using Jenkins plugin manager
. Install the crap4j plugin in your Jenkins, if downloaded manually
. Configure your project's build script to generate crap4j XML reports
(This happens along with the HTML report)
. Enable the "Publish Crap" publisher on the job configuration page
. Specify the directory where the crap4j report (report.xml) is
generated
. Perform some builds to receive a trend

The crap4j plugin currently has no configurable parameters. The build
health indicator is set to the http://crap4j.org/faq.html[Crap4J quality
suggestion], with 15% crappy methods being 0% build health.
