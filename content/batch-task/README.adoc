This plugin adds batch tasks that are not regularly executed to
projects, such as releases, integration, archiving, etc. In this way,
anyone in the project team can execute them in a way that leaves a
record.

[[BatchTaskPlugin-Usage]]
== Usage

When you install this plugin, your project configuration page gets
additional "batch tasks" option as illustrated below:

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .image-center-wrapper]#image:docs/images/task-config.png[image]#

A batch task consists of a shell script and a name. When you execute a
build, the shell script gets run on the workspace, just like a build.
Batch tasks and builds "lock" the workspace, so when one of those
activities is in progress, all the others will block in the queue.

Once a task is configured, the project top page gets "task(s)" link, as
illustrated below:

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/task-project-top.png[image]#

If you click that, you can see the status of all the tasks. You can
schedule the execution of a task from here, too. Task executions are
numbered like "123-456" where 123 portion refers to the latest build and
456 portion refers to the sequential number (so that you can execute a
task multiple times with the same build.) The build number portion is
significant because when a batch task runs, it sees the workspace as of
the result of this build.

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/task-top.png[image]#

The details of the task execution and its console output are available
by further clicking a task of the interest, as below:
