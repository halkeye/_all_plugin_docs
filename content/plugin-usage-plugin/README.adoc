This plugin gives you the possibility to analyze the usage of your
installed plugins.

[[PluginUsagePlugin(Community)-Usage]]
== Usage

You can find the plugin on sidepanel of Jenkins. Every user is able to
use this plugin.

The plugin will give you a report on how much every plugin will be used
in all of your jobs (see the screenshot below). Therefore it will
analyze the used extension points of each job. +
*Plugins used in pipeline scripts would not be listed normally as used
by jobs, because they are used dynamically in Jenkinsfiles.*
