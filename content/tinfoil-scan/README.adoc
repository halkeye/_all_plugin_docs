== Tinfoil Security Plugin

[.conf-macro .output-inline]#Allows you to run web security tests from
the cloud using https://www.tinfoilsecurity.com/[Tinfoil Security].# +

[[TinfoilSecurityPlugin-Setup]]
=== Setup

[[TinfoilSecurityPlugin-GlobalConfiguration]]
==== Global Configuration

If you navigate to 'Manage Jenkins > Configure System', you should see a
section labeled Tinfoil Security. Here, you'll be able to set your
Tinfoil API keys, as well as optionally set a hostname of your Tinfoil
Security installation if you are using the Tinfoil appliance and proxy
information if needed.

 +

First though, you'll need to get your API keys. To generate a set of API
keys, log in to your Tinfoil Security account and navigate to
https://www.tinfoilsecurity.com/add_ons. From there, you can select the
checkbox to enable the Tinfoil API and create an API key. Make sure you
create a 'Full Access' API key pair, since 'Read-Only' API keys cannot
start scans. Keep in mind you won't see the actual values of your API
keys until you've clicked 'Save'.

Then hit the 'add' button on the credentials line and select the context
you want to add the credentials to ('Jenkins' is the default)

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .confluence-embedded-manual-size]#image:docs/images/jenkinsConfigWSCAN1.png[image,height=212]#

Choose the 'Username with password' kind and fill in your Access Key as
the username and Secret Key as the password.

[[TinfoilSecurityPlugin-Per-ProjectConfiguration]]
==== Per-Project Configuration

For each project in your Jenkins installation. You can configure a
Tinfoil Security Post-build Action which allows you to specify a Tinfoil
Site ID for the site you want to scan at the end of your Jenkins build.

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/project_settings.png[image]#

To find your Site ID, you need to log in to your Tinfoil Security
account and navigate to the settings panel for the site you want to
scan. Underneath the site name and URL, you should see the
auto-generated Site ID for that site.

[[TinfoilSecurityPlugin-Usage]]
=== Usage

To use the Tinfoil Security plugin, just run a build. When Jenkins
performs the Tinfoil Security post-build action, you will see a message
like this in your console output telling you everything is working.
