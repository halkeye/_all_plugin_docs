[[Environmentdashboardplugin-Summary]]
== Summary

***Note - Enable Auto Refresh at the top right of the view so that the
view is auto updated.*

This Jenkins plugin creates a custom view which can be used as a
dashboard to display which code release versions have been deployed to
which test and production environments (or devices).

[[Environmentdashboardplugin-ExampleSetup]]
=== Example Set up

You have 3 software components:

* UI
* Web Application and API
* Database

Each component has a corresponding Jenkins "build and package" job that
creates new environment agnostic build packages and puts the code into
something like Nexus waiting for someone to pick it up and deploy it.

You have 4 environments

* CI Test
* Performance Test
* Pre-production
* Production

You have Jenkins jobs for deploying build packages to your environments.

You find it hard to track which version of each application is currently
deployed to.

You configure your deployment jobs to publish a record of each
deployment to this plugin.

You create a view which displays a matrix with rows for your 3
applications, columns for your environments and the intersections with
the deployed code version.

[[Environmentdashboardplugin-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

After installing the plugin, you'll get a new option in the Build
Environment section of a job configuration page. If your job deploys to
an environment, check the box and complete the form using the context
sensitive help.

You can also specify how long to retain the dashboard data, the default
is set to 30 days. Any data older than 30 days from the current time is
automatically deleted.

Once you have run at least one job with a populated Details for
Environment dashboard section, you now have enough data to generate a
dashboard. On the Jenkins home page, click the + to create a new view
and create a view. If you leave all settings blank, you will see the
deployments of all components into all environments. You can also limit
the deployment history shown when you click on the environment name on
the dashboard. The default is last 10 deploys.
