This plugin sends messages to an MQ, e.g. RabbitMQ whenever a build is
started and finished. It also sends a message when a build enters and
leaves the queue. +
By extending this plugin, developers can add events for when to send
messages to MQ.

==== [#MQNotifierPlugin-Generalinformation]####General information

The plugin connects to an MQ, e.g. RabbitMQ and sends messages during
specific events. In its first version, the messages are sent when:

* A build is added to the queue
* A build leaves the queue (either to be built or is cancelled)
* A build starts
* A build finishes (either when the build is finished or when it is
aborted)

The basic use case is for other systems to interact with Jenkins. An
example is a system that triggers a build using the rest API of
Jenkins, +
then waits for the build to finish. The system wants to present
information about these builds. The alternative to listening to an MQ is
for the system +
to continuously poll Jenkins for information of the build status.

Other events can be added to the plugin by extending it.

The settings are all MQ-related. The only required settings are the MQ
URI, for where to find the MQ server and Exchange name, +
for where to send the messages inside the MQ. The other settings are all
optional and related to your MQ setup, you can read more +
about them at e.g. the RabbitMQ site here:
