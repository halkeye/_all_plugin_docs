== User guide

{empty}1. Add "Script Selection task" variable to your project. You need
to specify the path to executable file and several delimeters. See the
picture below.

{empty}2. Our idea is quite simple. We have a folder with Selenium
tests. We want to select some of them using Hudson UI. Executable file
knows the structure of the directory with Selenium tests.

Executable file writes directory structure to standard output stream.
So, plugin runs the executable file and reads standard output stream.
Example of executable file

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/4.jpg[image]#

{empty}3. If you press "Build now" button you will see the tree like
this

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/5.jpg[image]#

{empty}4. Select several tests and press "Build" button. For example

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/6.jpg[image]#

{empty}5. In build parameters you may see

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/7.jpg[image]#

{empty}6. You may use this variable in your Linux or Windows scripts.
And you may use selected value as default value for this type of
variable.
