[[ArtifactDiffPlugin-Artifactdiffplugin]]
== Artifact diff plugin

Plugin can compare content of an artifact identified by its relative
path among different builds.

[[ArtifactDiffPlugin-URLformat]]
=== URL format

Plugin introduces transient build action using `+artifact-diff+` url
name. Action itself consumes build number to compare against followed by
an artifact path.

__<buildUrl>__`+/artifact-diff/+`__<otherBuildNumber>__`+/+`_<artifactPath>_

The `+output+` argument is used to switch between the `+html+` (the
default) and `+plain+` text output.

* output = html|plain

[[ArtifactDiffPlugin-Outputformat]]
=== Output format

* Plugin uses the Unified diff format to represent artifact difference.
* `+/dev/null+` placeholder filename is used to represent an artifact
that could not be read, such artifact is then treated as empty.
* An empty diff sequence is used when both artifacts equal.
