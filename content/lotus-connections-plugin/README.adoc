This plugin posts build results to Lotus Connections.

 +

Each Lotus Connection update will contain the job name, build number,
The number of tests executed, passed, failed and the pass rate (%).

For example

TT_BVT_WMB (96) : Tests Executed = 600 Tests Passed = 126 Tests Failed =
474 Pass Rate = 21.00 %

The core workings came from a sample on this site
