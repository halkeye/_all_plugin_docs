== About

[.conf-macro .output-inline]#A SmartBear plugin for running TestComplete
tests from Jenkins.#

The plugin provides a build step that lets you include your TestComplete
tests in your Jenkins freestyle jobs and Pipelines. In addition, the
plugin keeps a list of test runs and lets you view test results directly
from Jenkins.

[[TestCompleteSupportPlugin-PrepareNodes]]
== Prepare Nodes

Prepare a test computer (node) for automated testing. Make sure the node
has everything it needs to run tests successfully:

* TestComplete or TestExecute is installed on them.
* The required browsers and applications are installed on the nodes.
* TestComplete project files are copied to your node workspace.
* The required test data files and other helper files reside on the
nodes.
* If you have a desktop tested application, make sure the application is
installed on the nodes before running TestComplete tests. +
 +
To copy files to the nodes, you can, for example, use the Folder Copy
operation of
the https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/File+Operations+Plugin[File
Operations Plugin].

[[TestCompleteSupportPlugin-Usage]]
== Usage

* Freestyle Jobs
* Pipeline
* View Test Results

[[TestCompleteSupportPlugin-FreestyleJobs]]
=== _Freestyle Jobs_

To run your TestComplete tests as part of a Jenkins job:

. Add the TestComplete Test step to your Jenkins job.
. Configure the step: +
* Select the test runner: TestComplete or TestExecute.
* Specify the TestComplete project suite file and select tests to be
run.
* Important: Select the *Run interactive user session* check box, if
needed (see below), and specify additional parameters for the run.
. Run the build as you normally would. 

[[TestCompleteSupportPlugin-Pipeline]]
=== _Pipeline_

_To run your TestComplete tests as part of a Jenkins Pipeline: +
_

. Add code that will run your TestComplete tests to your Pipeline script
(Jenkinsfile).
. To generate the needed code, you can use the built-in Jenkins Snippet
Generator utility: +
* Click the *Pipeline Syntax* link in the *Pipeline* section of your
project.
* In the *Sample Step* drop-down list, select testcompletetest:
TestComplete Test.
* Configure the step as described in the instruction for freestyle jobs
above (select a test runner, specify a project suite and tests to run,
and so on).
* Click *Generate Pipeline Script*. Copy the generated code and then
paste it to your Pipeline script.
. Run your Pipeline as you normally would.

[[TestCompleteSupportPlugin-ViewTestResults]]
=== _View Test Results_

After your build run is over, you can see the TestComplete Test Results
link on the build page. +
Click the link to view test results. In the subsequent screen, click the
link in the Test column to explore detailed test results.

[[TestCompleteSupportPlugin-Important]]
==== Important

Your test nodes must *run an interactive user session*. Otherwise,
TestComplete (or TestExecute) will be unable to interact with the UI of
the application under test.

To create an interactive user session:

* If you use TestComplete 10.6 or later, we recommend that you enable
the *Run interactive user session* option of the TestComplete Test step
(if you use Pipeline, set the useTCService parameter of the step to
true).
* If you unable to use this approach for some reason, then an
alternative to run an interactive user session is to launch the node and
control it via Java Web Start.
