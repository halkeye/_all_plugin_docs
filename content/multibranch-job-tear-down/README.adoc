This plugin triggers/schedules a job to run when a multibranch workflow
job is disabled or deleted. Essential use case is you have a multibranch
job that spins up some infrastructure like a server, when the job is
deleted this plugin enables you to tear down said infrastructure and
clean up after yourself.

[[MultibranchJobTearDownPlugin-BasicSetup]]
== Basic Setup

There are three ways to use this plugin but they require that you create
a job that accepts a String parameter of `git_url` and
`branch_name`.[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .confluence-embedded-manual-size]#image:docs/images/Screen_Shot_2018-10-26_at_10.54.06_AM.png[image,height=250]#

[[MultibranchJobTearDownPlugin-ExpressSetup]]
=== Express Setup

Simply create a job named `job-tear-down-executor` the plugin
automatically detects if this job is present and will send all branch
deletions to this job.

[[MultibranchJobTearDownPlugin-ConfiguretheJob]]
=== Configure the Job

In the global setting section of Jenkins you can configure the job name
that should be executed if you don't want to call your job
`job-tear-down-executor`
