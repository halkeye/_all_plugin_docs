[[NaginatorPlugin-Description]]
== Description

This plugin allows you to automatically reschedule a build after a build
failure.

 +
This can be useful in several cases, including:

* The build is dependent upon external resources, that were temporarily
unavailable (DB down, network down, website down, etc).
* Users want continuous emails sent out until the build is fixed, in
order to prompt people into action.

[[NaginatorPlugin-Configuration]]
== Configuration

Simply install the plugin, and then check the Post-Build action "Retry
build after failure" on your project's configuration page.

If the build fails, it will be rescheduled to run again after the time
you specified. You can choose how many times to retry running the job.
For each consecutive unsuccessful build, you can choose to extend the
waiting period.

The following options are also available:

* Rerun build for unstable builds as well as failures
* Only rebuild the job if the build's log output contains a given
regular expression
* Rerun build only for the failed parts of a matrix job

The plugin also adds a rerun button for in the build section.
