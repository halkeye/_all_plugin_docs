[[ExtremeFeedbackPlugin-Configuration]]
== Configuration

The Aggregate option combines results all the jobs tied to a lamp to a
single status. The overall result will always be the 'lowest
denominator' meaning if you have 3 jobs tied to the lamp and one of the
jobs is 'red' the lamp will show 'red' as status.

If the aggregate option is off the lamp will display the result of the
job that ran last.

The Alarm option makes a very noisy beep sound when a build fails.

The SFX sounds can be configured to some extend. If the SFX option is on
the Lamp will play a file by random from one of the directories on the
lamp, depending on the job status: +
/home/pi/extremefeedbacklamp/XFD-Audio/Green +
/home/pi/extremefeedbacklamp/XFD-Audio/Yellow +
/home/pi/extremefeedbacklamp/XFD-Audio/Red 

You can ssh into the lamp and place your own files (mp3) in the folders,
then they will be considered when playing a sound.
