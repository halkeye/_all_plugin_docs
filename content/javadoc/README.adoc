This plugin adds Javadoc support to Jenkins.This functionality used to
be a part of the core, but as of Jenkins 1.431, it was split off into
separate plugins.

The plugin enables the selection of "Publish Javadoc" as Post-build
action, specifying the directory where the Javadoc is to be gathered and
if retention is expected for each successful build.
