This plugin lists up all the iOS devices connected to the master and all
the Jenkins slaves, and provide operations to them.

Specifically, the current version provides the following
functionalities:

* UI that lists all the connected devices and their properties.
* Build step that lets you deploy *.ipa to a device (a build running on
one slave can deploy app to iOS connected to another slave.)
* Web UI and CLI commands to deploy *.ipa
