This plugin makes it possible to copy artifacts to remote locations.

[[ArtifactDeployerPlugin-HistoryandObjectives]]
== History and Objectives

By default, Jenkins archives artifacts generated by the build. These
artifacts are stored in the JENKINS_HOME directory with all other
elements such as job configuration files. +
There is no separation between infrastructure elements, project elements
and outputs. +
It is often considered to be a bad practice and it doesn't help to
manage JENKINS_HOME directory from an administrator point of view
(backup issues, etc). +
And for now, we can't change the 'Archived artifacts' location.

ArtifactDeployer plugin enables you to archive build artifacts to any
remote locations such as to a separate file server (outside of
JENKINS_HOME directory).

There are many other Jenkins plugins close to ArtifactDeployer such as
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Copy+Artifact+Plugin[CopyArtifact
plugin] or
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/CopyArchiver+Plugin[CopyArchiver
plugin] for publishing artifacts from Jenkins resources (from the
current workspace, from the old builds of the same job or other jobs,
...) to remote locations with the protocol file:// +
There are also others plugins for managing other protocols such as
ftp://, ssh:///.

But none of these plugins provides a common way to manage the
deployment.

ArtifactDeployer is a complete alternative to the built-in Jenkins
feature "Archiving artefacts' and it is aimed at providing an uniform
deployment mechanism.

[[ArtifactDeployerPlugin-Features]]
== Features

* Copies build artifacts from the workspace to a remote location shared
on the build processor node
* Provides links to archived artefacts from the job status page
* Deletes on demand archived artifacts when the build is removed

[[ArtifactDeployerPlugin-Limitations]]
== Limitations

* Only file deployment is supported
* For downloading deployed artifacts, remote location must be accessible
from the Jenkins master
* Jenkins process must have the right permissions to write in the
specified location
