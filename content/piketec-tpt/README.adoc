[.conf-macro .output-inline]#TPT is a testing and verification tool for
embedded control systems. TPT can test MATLAB Simulink or dSPACE
TargetLink models, ETAS ASCET models, C-Code or test via MiL, SiL, PiL
and HiL. The PikeTec TPT Plugin allows users to execute tests modeled in
http://www.piketec.com/en/2/tpt.html[TPT (Time Partition Testing)] via
Jenkins. A XML file can be generated in JUnit format for the reporting
of test results. You can also display the TPT test report in Jenkins.# +

[[PikeTecTPTPlugin-Usage]]
== Usage

We will give you a short overview here. If you need a more detailed
description please refere to the chapterÂ _Jenkins Continuous
Integration_ of TPT manual.

The plugin provides two build steps:

. _Execute TPT test cases:_ The TPT test cases are executed and the test
results are converted into JUnit-XML files. If Jenkins is operating as
master in master-slave-mode, it will delegate the work to slave jobs.
. _Execute TPT tests slave:_ Execute __ the work delegated to it by
_Execute TPT test cases_ in master slave mode.

You have two options to publish the TPT test results:

. Add a _TPT Report_ post build action to your job to display the TPT
report in Jenkins.
. Configure the build steps to transform the test results into the JUnit
format and then publish the results in Jenkins using the _Publish JUnit
test result report_ post build action provided by the
https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/JUnit+Plugin[JUnit Plugin].

[[PikeTecTPTPlugin-UsingonlyExecuteTPTtestcases(notmasterslavemode)]]
=== Using only _Execute TPT test cases_ (not master slave mode)

Simply create a new Jenkins Job and add the _Execute TPT test cases_
build step and configure it as needed. Do not set the option "Distribute
work to TPT slave jobs".

Make sure:

* The TPT software is installed on the computers where tests should be
run.
* All 3^rd^ party tools needed on the Jenkins node where the job will
run are available.
* The correct TPT project file is available (use e.g. SCM checkout to
check this).
* The Junit XML directory is placed in the workspace of the job in case
you want to publish the test results to Jenkins.

[[PikeTecTPTPlugin-UsingonlyExecuteTPTtestcasesandExecuteTPTtestsslave(masterslavemode)]]
=== Using only _Execute TPT test cases_ and _Execute TPT tests slave_ (master slave mode)

You can configure the _Execute TPT test cases_ build step to delegate
the work to a slave job by setting the option "Distribute work to TPT
slave jobs". The slave job must contain a _Execute TPT tests slave_
build step.

The _Execute TPT test cases_ build step will open the specified TPT
file, lookup the tests, split them in packages with an equal number of
tests and starts for each package a build of the slave job.

When all slave jobs are finished the _Execute TPT test cases_ build step
will copy the test data into its workspace. The job will now generate an
overall report and If you configured the job for publishing via JUnit
the JUNit XML files.

Make sure:

* Only one slave job build runs on a node at any given time.
* The TPT software is installed on the computers where tests should be
run.
* All 3^rd^ party tools needed on the Jenkins node where the job will
run are available.
* The correct TPT project file is available (use e.g. SCM checkout to
check this).
* The Junit XML directory is placed in the workspace of the job in case
you want to publish the test results to Jenkins.

The _Execute TPT tests slave_ will communicate with TPT via a network
protocol (Java RMI). If two builds are using the same port and would run
on the same node the outcome of the execution would be nondeterministic.
Use e.g. the
https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Throttle+Concurrent+Builds+Plugin[Throttle
Concurrent Builds Plugin] to prevent builds from runnig on the same
node.

[[PikeTecTPTPlugin-FAQ]]
== FAQ

_TPT hangs/does not start when I use Jenkins. If I start TPT normally it
works fine. +
_

This is usually a problem with the licensing. Since Jenkins normally
runs as a service with a different user TPT will access other settings
than when executed manually. If you have a correctly configured TPT you
can copy the license configuration file
"%LOCALAPPDATA%\TPT\$InstallDirName_hash$\license_serverconfig.cfg"
(please replace $InstallDirName_hash$ by your TPT installation directory
name and the hash) into the TPT installation directory and rename it to
"license_default.cfg". If TPT does not find a license configuration it
will use these instead.

Please note that other 3rd party tools as MATLAB Simulink or ETAS ASCET
may have their own issues running in a service environment.

 +

_I cannot publish the TPT test results. The JUnit publisher cannot find
anything._

The JUnit publisher can only find files in the workspace of the Job
while the _Execute TPT test cases_ allows you to create the XMLfiles
anywhere in the file system. Please ensure you configured the paths
correctly. You can use a relative path. A valid configuration would be
"junit" as the path given to the build step and "junit/*.xml" given to
the publisher.
