[.conf-macro .output-inline]#This plugin integrates Polyspace® products
with Jenkins for automated analysis. Polyspace® static code analysis
products can prove absence of critical run-time errors using formal
methods, find hundreds of classes of bugs, and check for adherence to
coding rules (MISRA C, MISRA C++, JSF++) and security rules (CWE,
CERT-C, CERT-C++, ISO/IEC 17961).# +

[[MathWorksPolyspacePlugin-Features]]
== Features

* Automating code analysis with Polyspace Bug Finder Server or Polyspace
Code Prover Server
* Avoiding regressions from new code checks-ins with pass/fail criteria
for builds based on Polyspace results
* Uploading Polyspace results to a web server for collaborative review
* Assigning owners to results based on predefined criteria such as file
ownership
* Sending e-mail notifications with new findings

[[MathWorksPolyspacePlugin-ProductRequirements]]
== Product Requirements

You require these products to use the MathWorks Polyspace plugin in
Jenkins:

* To run a Polyspace analysis, install *Polyspace Bug Finder Server* or
*Polyspace Code Prover Server*. The installation provides executables
for running Polyspace, uploading results to the Polyspace Access web
interface (if configured) and exporting results to a text file.
* To review Polyspace results along with source code and details on an
interactive web view, set up the components required to host the
*Polyspace Access* web interface.

For installation steps, see
https://www.mathworks.com/help/polyspace_bug_finder_server/gs/install-products-required-for-polyspace-analysis-on-server.html[Polyspace
documentation].

Note: These Polyspace products are available in MathWorks releases
R2019a and beyond. For releases prior to R2019a, you can use the Jenkins
plugin with an installation of the desktop products, Polyspace Bug
Finder or Polyspace Code Prover, and use the older Polyspace Metrics web
interface to host results. However, the Polyspace Metrics web interface
shows only an overview of Polyspace results for a project. To see the
result details, you have to download the results back to the desktop
product.

[[MathWorksPolyspacePlugin-GettingStarted]]
== Getting Started

After you install Polyspace Bug Finder Server or Polyspace Code Prover
Server and set up the Polyspace Access (or Polyspace Metrics) web
interface, you can use the Jenkins plugin to run Polyspace during
continuous integration. To start using the plugin:

. Configure the plugin to point to your Polyspace Server installation
folder and Polyspace Access server settings. +
 +
. Set up a Jenkins project to run a Polyspace analysis in isolation or
along with other scripts.

* {blank}
** In the *Build Environment* section of a Jenkins project, refer to a
specific Polyspace Server installation and Polyspace Access server.
** In the *Build* section of the project, enter Windows batch files or
Shell scripts to run Polyspace.
** In the *Post-build Actions* section of the project, set up e-mail
notification to send e-mails with Polyspace result files created through
your build scripts. You can send a common e-mail to all recipients or
send individual e-mails to file owners. The Polyspace result files
contain a list of results along with links to results in the Polyspace
Access web interface.
