The purpose of this plugin is to bring true inheritance of properties
between multiple job definitions to Jenkins. This allows you to define
common properties only once and inherit them to multiple projects.

[[inheritance-plugin-Description]]
== Description 

The role of this plug-in can be broadly described as bringing the
concept of *property inheritance* to Jenkins. The goal is to fulfil the
following statements:

* _Instead of having to define the same property multiple times across
as many projects; it should be possible for many projects to refer to
the same property that is defined only once._ +
or rephrased:
* _Everything that is defined multiple times but used in the same way,
should be defined only once and simply referred to many times._

In a way, you can think of this plugin this way: *If Jenkins is the C
language, this plugin is its C++ equivalent.*

Ideal candidates for this are, for example, the SCM setup, common
pre-build and post-build steps as well as cleanup and logging
properties.

Additionally, the plugin offers the following nice feature additions:

* A simple versioning system, allowing you to easily go back to a past
version of any job configuration and test new features without affecting
the runtime. +
 
* The ability to use a custom workspace location (that can optionally
make use of parameter values) that uses Jenkins' workspace locking
mechanism so that the Job can still be executed multiple times on the
same host without collision.
** This is highly useful if many projects make use of the same remote
repository. Just use the repository name as workspace location to cut
down on the number of workspaces. +
 
* The ability to automatically generate child jobs by joining multiple
parent jobs together according to a parameterized "recipe".
** _Do note_ that this ability is currently too inflexible for broad
use. It will be made much easier to use in future versions, though. +
 
* Possibility to define a special "magic" label that makes sure that
only those jobs that depend on this label get executed on a host. +
Think of it this way:
** Normal Jenkins labels are useful to make sure that a particular set
of jobs can run on a particular set of machines.
** The "magic" node label makes sure that *only* a particular set of
jobs can run on a  particular set of machines -- and no others.
** More precisely, it makes sure that those jobs that *do not reference
the label* will *not* be executed on those hosts that *have this label.*

[[inheritance-plugin-KnownIssues:]]
=== Known Issues:

There are the known issues for version 19.08.02.

* JaCoCo plugin
** The JaCoCo build trend graph does not render correctly, if the JaCoCo
property is inherited, instead of defined on the leaf projects. +
The coverage report shows up, but the graph will fail to load
properly. +
This can lead to all HTTP threads of Jenkins to become busy with
rendering the graph, until the action times out and fails (after 1-2
minutes).

[[inheritance-plugin-Changelog]]
== Changelog

[[inheritance-plugin-Version19.08.02(20.August2019)]]
=== *Version 19.08.02 (20. August 2019)*

The 19.08.01 version had an issue, where the "Archive the artifacts"
post-build step was unconditionally hidden from the config screen.

That was acceptable for the internal release, but of course not for the
wider open source release.

This version is the same as 19.08.01, but defaults to keeping the
post-build step visible while offering a global configuration option to
disallow the step, if need be.

[[inheritance-plugin-Version19.08.01(20.August2019)]]
=== *Version 19.08.01 (20. August 2019)*

This release combines all the changes that we implemented since 2017 for
our internal version. +
It also aligns the externally visible versioning scheme to the one used
internally at Intel, which will make it easier to align the code more
often. Versions will now be numbered with a "Year.Month.Release" scheme.

The most relevant changes are:

* Moved Jenkins Core dependency from 1.625.3 to 2.107.3
* Require at least Java 8 for running (same as Jenkins Core)
* Add a way to mark jobs as "templates" so that they can be copied from
the "New Item/Job" page without needing to type their name
* Fixed the "Get Build Flow" page, to makes it work more reliable on
very complex jobs.
* When rebuilding a job:
** Fixed issues with "Multi-Line" parameter fields
** Fixed issue with certain job versions not showing up
* Fixed issue with references becoming stale when renaming inheritance
jobs

[[inheritance-plugin-Version2.0.0(14.March2017)]]
=== *Version 2.0.0 (14. March 2017)*

This commit combines all the changes that we implemented in 2015 on
GitHub (without a release) and in the past 2 years for our internal
version. +
Since this is a dramatic and large change, the version was set to 2.0.0.

The code should be compatible with servers that were running the last
version 1.5.3 (as long as they're running Jenkins > v1.625.3), but no
guarantees can be made, as we can't check all edge-cases. +
As such *extreme care* should be taken when upgrading from 1.5.3.

The most relevant changes are:

* The plugin now handles the "full name" of projects correctly. This
enables compatibility with the CloudBees "Folders" plugin.
* Improved reporting of cycles and missing parameters in the
inheritance. For example, the warning now lists the exact path of the
cycle.
* Child jobs are now properly marked as unbuildable when there's a
missing parameter or parent job, even when there are many levels of
inheritance between it and the missing job/parameter.
* Job configuration "save" button will now check for errors (red text)
in the configuration form and prevent you from saving if errors are
present. +
This is avoids errors on the page from creating half-changed jobs.
* The "Apply" button has been removed, as it does not allow giving a
text for the new version that is created.
* When a build is started with a different version, a build description
is automatically added.
* Fixed various issues relating to rebuilding existing jobs. +
Examples: Wrong versions, missing parameters, etc. pp.
* Fixed leaks in the version handling, that sometimes caused builds to
be started with versions selected for a wholly different run, or with a
more recent unstable version, even if a stable version was selected.
* Improved layout of various overview pages:
** Inheritance relationships,
** Versioning and diff tables
** 'Full build flow' for parameters and shells executed by a build
** Parameter derivation page
* Made version comparison page hot-linkable:
'/showDiffOfVersions?left=<num>&right=<num>'
* The "/job/<name>/config.xml" now accepts a "?version=<num>" parameter
and will also, by default, show the XML of the last stable version,
instead of the last-saved version.
* Creating a new job as a copy of an existing job will now also use the
version currently marked as stable, instead of the last saved one.
* Inheritable Parameter References no longer store unused fields in the
XML that only belong to "real" parameters.
* Inheritable Parameters now have full control over how Whitespaces are
handled (i.e. are they kept, removed or automatically added?)
* Parameters are now aware of the inheritance as it is defined on the
current configuration page. It is no longer necessary to save the
project after changing the parentage to use "parameter references".
* Made "rebuild" plugin mandatory, as not having it led to confusing
exceptions during boot.
* Fixed various exceptions raised in the GUI as well as backend.
* Removed a possible deadlock when deleting a job while saving another.

[[inheritance-plugin-Version1.5.3(29.July2014)]]
=== *Version 1.5.3 (29. July 2014)*

* Identical to v1.5.2. +
Maven botched the update process of 1.5.2. It missed uploading a commit
on Github and uploaded a "-snapshot" version to the Jenkins Maven repo.

[[inheritance-plugin-Version1.5.2(29.July2014)]]
=== *Version 1.5.2 (29. July 2014)*

* Added additional unittests for new features.
* Added REST API URLs that allow the user to get the full configuration
overview of a job, including all parents
(http://<jenkins>/job/<name>/getConfigAsXML?depth=1).
* Fixed rebuild not working for "hidden" parameters, this also adds
dynamically created parameters to the rebuild page.
* Save new version of Job, when project is updated via XML upload.
* Made the saving of the versions.xml.gz atomic.
* Fix issue with "hidden" parameters not being hidden from build page,
if a "parameter reference" was the last inherited parameter for a given
name
* Fixed issue with post-build steps not taking versioning into account
* Added compile-time check for Java6 compatibility
* Fixed issue with altering versioning information not triggering
automatic job creation. Now, any save of versioning will trigger
creation.
* Fix failure of parameter sanity check, when an inheritable parameter
referenced/overwrote a non-inheritable parameter.
* Forcing inheritance, when job properties are evaluated from a
BuildStep
* Fixed issue with parameters being derived wrong.  When a reference to
a reference was selected, the inheritance mode (Overwritable,
Extensible, Fixed) was not computed properly.
* Fixed triggers (like the Gerrit or Timed Triggers) not forcing
inheritance of values, thus only using locally defined parameters, etc.
pp.

[[inheritance-plugin-Version1.5.1(13.April2014)]]
=== *Version 1.5.1 (13. April 2014)*

* Fixed issue with build flow view not displaying all parents
* Fixed issue with label generation due to caching overriding
inheritance. Cached labels now always use fully inherited values.
* Added option to retrieve an XML containing the settings of all parents
in one file.
* Reduced usage of the ThreadAssocStore, that should prevent versions
from spilling from one request to another, which could cause the
"isBuildable()" check to fail.
* Restored configuration for SCMs that were missing in v1.5.0
* Added extended build information added to main project page
* Some internal minor code reorganization and bug fixes
* Fixed error that spuriously declared parameter classes as
incompatible, thus failing a build before it even started.
* Converted several Jelly to Groovy files and fixed the layout of the
build-flow view
* Exchanged names like "Transient Project" with more intuitive ones
("Compounds" in this case)
* The warning messages for fixed parameters now evaluate correctly
* Fixed issue where invalid parameters were not detected, if the final
build was not transient.
* Fixed aborting when a variable was declared as "must have a value
set".
* Force users to enter a versioning string before saving
* Fixed issue with URL encoding on rebuild-page (and others) -- applies
to running behind a URL-rewriting Apache Proxy
* Added a size-limited LRU buffer for decoding the version map. This
hould slightly speed up accessing specific versions of projects.
* Added notification banner to main project page, to inform the user
about the state of versioning of the job (stable/non-stable)
* Fixed Compound configuration sceen not using the correct versions of
jobs
* Fixed stack-overflow when generating transient actions.

[[inheritance-plugin-Version1.5.0(16.December2013)]]
=== *Version 1.5.0 (16. December 2013)*

* Great improvements to Java reflection caching. This improves
performance of the plug-in quite a bit. (Thanks to Andreas Gudian)
* Fixed issue with the "Keep build forever" button not appearing.
* Added new configuration read/view/download page for project- and
build-pages. This allows you to see all build steps and final parameter
evaluations on one page; sorted by which project contributed it.
* Added experimental support for inheriting triggers. This feature
currently defaults to being disabled; but prints a warning to users on
each project page that the new feature is present and can be enabled at
any time.
* Fixed issue with several links missing the "context-URL", if Jenkins
ran inside a context-ed container.
* SVG Graph now honours order of inheritance. Inverted the direction of
the arrows for more clarity of how properties flow from parents to
children.
* Added table that shows last builds sorted by build time.
* History table is hidden when a project is not buildable and has no
previous runs.
* Fixed issue with non-existing references resetting to default. Now,
the old value can be kept around; as the plug-in will detect missing
projects anyway.
* Fixed Null Pointer Exception bug in jobs without any parameters.
* Implemented caching of generated labels for Jobs. This leads to a
considerable speed boost if all build executors are busy and many jobs
queue up. It also fixes a rare issue where labels were not being
inherited correctly.

[[inheritance-plugin-Version1.4.12(10.October2013)]]
=== *Version 1.4.12 (10. October 2013)*

* Hotfix for v1.4.11 -- there was a regression with the "properties not
being evaluated in the correct order" bugfix.

[[inheritance-plugin-Version1.4.11.1(09.October2013)]]
=== *Version 1.4.11.1 (09. October 2013)*

* Identical to v1.4.11. Re-upload because maven created a snapshot
instead of release version

[[inheritance-plugin-Version1.4.11(03.October2013)]]
=== *Version 1.4.11 (03. October 2013)*

* Fixed issue with properties not being evaluated in the correct order
-- some properties were being inherited multiple times, if defined in
different parents.
* Layouting fixes and improved support for context-based URLs on many
GUI pages
* Replaced many Jelly pages with Groovy scripts
* Changed name of "Child Job Creation" to "Compound Creation".
* Added additional a table to the project overview page to more
immediately see direct parents and children that are leafs.
* Moved "project class" from compound-config page to general page. This
makes sense, as this field can be used in the "Related Projects View" to
sort/filter projects
* Improved rendering of "range" slider element.
* Added option to disallow compound renaming (only relevant for
automatically created 'compound' jobs)
* Fixed issue with project-names instead of parameter-names being
displayed on "Show Parameter derivation" page

[[inheritance-plugin-Version1.4.10(16.September2013)]]
=== *Version 1.4.10 (16. September 2013)*

* Added new permission type "Configure Versions". This allows you to
split general "Configure" rights and the right to set a version to
stable. The "Administer" permission implies the right to configure
versions.
* Fixed issue with SubTasks not being inherited. Now, all properties
that contributed additional tasks to be processed on other Executors
should work correctly.
* Fixed Stack Overflow due to Parameter References. This could occur if
you defined the same parameter twice.

[[inheritance-plugin-Version1.4.9(22.August2013)]]
=== *Version 1.4.9 (22. August 2013)*

* Fixed issue with relative path in Jelly file for "Inheritable
Parameter" that caused issue if Jenkins server was a Windows host.
(Found and fixed by Steven Craft)
* Removed superfluous scanning of all projects when resolving project
references (improves speed on large installations)
* Fixed issue with broken links on th "Show References" page if Jenkins
ran in a context other than "/"
* Fixed several possible Null-Pointer-Exceptions in various parts of the
plug-in.
* Added several test-cases to prevent future regressions. Do note that
these tests are disabled on Windows, due to a bug in Jenkins < 1.520
* Fixed issue with the "magic node-label" (which, if set on a node,
makes sure that *only* tests that use that label are scheduled on this
machine) being applied wrong if a job had no label set at all.

[[inheritance-plugin-Version1.4.8(01.July2013)]]
=== *Version 1.4.8 (01. July 2013)*

* Initial public release
* Fixed deadlock occurring in certain situations involving build Queue
queries
* Added option to hide "rarely changed" build parameters from the build
screen.
