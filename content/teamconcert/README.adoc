With the build toolkit this plugin adds traceability links from a
Jenkins build to an RTC build result, workspace and snapshot.  It also
publishes links to work items, change sets and file contents captured in
the snapshot.  It leverages the current RTC features and workflows that
users are already familiar with such as, emails, toaster popups,

. Prior to 1.2.0.0 a job can be configured with RTC SCM using either a
build definition or a build workspace. In 1.2.0.0 there is support to

. To benefit most from the integration between this plugin and RTC
Build, select "Build Definition" from the Build Configuration dropdown
and enter a build definition ID. See the

build engine type] help topic to learn how to create a Jenkins build
definition. Follow these steps to setup a Jenkins Build Definition and
Jenkins Job to avoid a catch-22 situation.  A Jenkins job requires a
Hudson/Jenkins build definition and a Hudson/Jenkins build definition
requires a Jenkins job.  RTC actually won't let you save the build
definition without a job selected. However, Jenkins will let you save a
job without a build definition.  So it is important to configure your
build definition and job this way.
.. In Jenkins, create the job first using RTC for source control, but
with no build definition. Leave the _Build Definition_ text box blank.
Save the Jenkins Job.
.. In RTC, create a Jenkins build engine that connects to the Jenkins
server.
See https://jazz.net/help-dev/clm/topic/com.ibm.team.build.doc/topics/t_hudson_build_eng.html[Creating
a build engine]
.. In RTC, create a build definition that uses the build engine created
in step b and select the job created in step a.
See *https://jazz.net/help-dev/clm/topic/com.ibm.team.build.doc/topics/t_hudson_build_def.html[Creating
a build definition]*
.. Lastly, in Jenkins, open the Jenkins job and set the _Build
Definition_ field with the id of the build definition created in step c.

[[TeamConcertPlugin-UsingPipelineasSCM]]
=== Using Pipeline as SCM

Team Concert Plugin supports Pipeline as SCM but doesn't support
lightweight checkout. Captured below are some ways to use this pipeline
feature with RTC SCM.

[[TeamConcertPlugin-Whenyouwishtocheckoutthesamecontentthatwasinitiallyloadedinthemasterunderpipeline@scriptfolderbyPipelinescriptfromSCM:]]
==== When you wish to checkout the same content that was initially loaded in the master under pipeline@script folder by Pipeline script from SCM:

Note: In this case, you should set skipDefaultCheckout(true). Otherwise
a checkout will happen everytime an agent directive is used. The
following snippet can be used to skip default checkout

....
options {skipDefaultCheckout()}
....

[[TeamConcertPlugin-Scenario1-Noloadrulesinthesecondcheckout]]
===== Scenario 1 - No load rules in the second checkout

{empty}1. Checkout only the JenkinsFile using minimal load rules. That
is, configure  load rules  in the pipeline job's SCM configuration to
load just the JenkinsFile and nothing else. This can be done for build
definition, repository workspace, snapshot and stream configuration.
This keeps the loading time very minimal in the master.

{empty}2. Inside the JenkinsFile, if you want to checkout on a slave or
master again (not under pipeline@script folder), load the snapshot. For
build definition and personal builds triggered from RTC, checkout the
build definition once again.

....
For Build Definition

node ("slavexyz") {
if ("${env.personalBuild}" == "true") { // This is true when a personal build is started from RTC.
          echo "Checking out the build definition in node"
          checkout([$class: 'RTCScm', avoidUsingToolkit: false, buildType: [buildDefinition: '<build definition used in Pipeline script from SCM>', customizedSnapshotName: '', value: 'buildDefinition'], overrideGlobal: false timeout: 480'])

[[TeamConcertPlugin-Scenario2-Loadrulesinthesecondcheckout]]
===== Scenario 2 - Load rules in the second checkout

{empty}1. Checkout the JenkinsFile using minimal load rules. That is,
configure  load rules  in the pipeline job's SCM configuration to load
just the JenkinsFile and nothing else. This can be done for build
definition, repository workspace, snapshot and stream configuration.
This keeps the loading time very minimal in the master.

{empty}2. Inside the JenkinsFile, if you want to checkout on a slave or
master again (in a different path), configure different load rules that
will load the content required for the build. Note that you can
parameterize the load rules using Jenkins Job property instead of
directly providing the value.

_Note: For Build definition, personal builds are not supported when load
rules or components to include/exclude are used in Jazz SCM
configuration in the build defintion. Therefore, the following sample
will error out when it sees a personal build_

_Note: You can use load rules or components to exclude. In the sample
below, I am assuming load rules. You can substitute loadPolicy with
useComponenLoadConfig and provide components to exclude._

[[TeamConcertPlugin-Whenyouwanttoloadnewcontentineveryagent(includingthemaster)aftertheinitialPipelinescriptfromSCMcheckout]]
==== When you want to load new content in every agent (including the master) after the initial Pipeline script from SCM checkout

You can add new checkout steps with different options (like loadrules,
or load directory) as required by directly referencing the build
definition, stream or build workspace in the JenkinsFile, instead of
loading from the last snapshot. If you have a build definition
configuration and the build is triggered from RTC, then multiple
checkouts on the same build definition will reuse the build result
instead of creating new ones. This is different from how it works when
the build is triggered from Jenkins where each checkout step with the
same build definition will still create new build results.

[[TeamConcertPlugin-Considerationswhenusingdeclarativepipeline]]
==== *Considerations when using declarative pipeline*

If you are using declarative pipeline, then every agent directive will
cause a checkout to happen in that agent using the same configuration
asPipeline Script from SCM. When using a build definition, stream or
workspace configuration, this will cause an accept to happen in each of
those cases, leading to different content being loaded in each agent. In
the case of build definition, an additional build result will be created
if the build is triggered from Jenkins. This may or may not be what you
want. If you want to prevent the extra checkout for every agent
directive, add the options directive below the agent directive with
skipDefaultCheckout(true) +

options {skipDefaultCheckout(true)}

Note : Even if you do not want to override global configuration for Team
Concert Plugin, the snippet generator will create a RTCScm snippet with
values for *serverUri*, *credentialsId*. If you copy this snippet into
your pipeline script, it could create maintenance issues when you intend
to change the global server URI, credentials and build tool kit. If you

[[TeamConcertPlugin-Master/SlaveConfiguration]]
=== Master/Slave Configuration

 +

Master and slave configurations are supported by this plugin.  See the
Jenkins documentation on
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Distributed+builds[distributed
builds] for more information.  The RTC build toolkit home path is
required for the master to be able to test connections and build
artifacts.

Note: If a password file is being used to authenticate with the RTC
server for a particular job, it is unnecessary to copy that file to each
of the slaves.  The master extracts the password from the password file
and passes it to each slave required.

. Navigate to the Jenkins /computer/? page (Jenkins > Manage Jenkins >
Manage Nodes) and click the "New Node" link.
. Enter a name and create a "Node name", select the "Dumb Slave" radio
button and click the "OK" button.
. In the node configuration page, find the "Node Properties" section and
check the "Tool Locations" check box.
. From the list of tool locations, select the build toolkit you want to
define for the node, and set the value in the "Home" field.
..  
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/node_configure_build_toolkit.png[image]#

Build toolkits can also be installed automatically on slaves.  And
labels can be used to match build toolkits to slaves.  However, a home
path is still required so the master can test connections and build
artifacts.

The following environment variables are available to the build after
Rational Team Concert source control step is completed.

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|property |description
|team_scm_changesAccepted |The number of changes accepted or discared
during the build.

|team_scm_snapshotUUID |UUID of the snapshot created after accepting
changes. Not set if no snapshot was created.

|team_scm_workspaceUUID |The UUID of the Repository workspace used in
the build. Only set if the build is using a build definition.

|buildResultUUID |UUID of the build result. Only set if the build is
using a build definition

|RTCBuildResultUUID |UUID of the build result. Only set if the build is
using a build definition

|requestUUID |UUID of the build request. Only set if the build is using
a build definition.

|buildDefinitionId |UUID of the build definition being used by the
build. Only set if the build is using a build definition.

|repositoryAddress |Address of the RTC repository.

|buildEngineId |Name of the build engine associated with the build
request/result (if there is a build result). An RTC build engine is not
actually running, but some ant tasks need the engine id.

|buildEngineHostName |Host name of the Jenkins master or slave that the
build is running on.

|buildRequesterUserId |User id of the RTC user that requested the build
be started. Only set if the build is using a build definition

|personalBuild |True if the build is a personal build (requested from
RTC), otherwise, not set

|rtcTempRepoWorkspaceName |The name of the temporary Repository
Workspace created during a build using Stream configuration

|rtcTempRepoWorkspaceUUID |The UUID of the temporary Repository
Workspace created during a build using Stream configuration
|===

Apart from these built-in properties, when using Build definition
configuration, all the build properties set in the build definition and
potentially modified when requesting the build will be available as
environment variables in the Jenkins build  after the Team Concert
plugin runs.

[[TeamConcertPlugin-AccessingRTCBuildpropertiesinaPipelinejobbeforecheckoutstepruns(onlyforBuilddefinitionconfiguration)]]
=== Accessing RTC Build properties in a Pipeline job before checkout step runs (only for Build definition configuration)

When using build definition configuration, you can access build
properties set in the RTC build result in the pipeline build even before
the checkout step runs. These could be built-in properties set in the
build result or user defined RTC build properties. In both cases, you
have to create a String parameter in the Jenkins job with the same name
as the RTC build property (built-in or user defined). The actual value
will be set by the RTC build result that starts the Jenkins build. You
can supply different values to the user defined RTC build properties
when requesting the RTC build.

The following built-in properties are available to the Jenkins build
even before the checkout step runs.

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|property |description
|buildResultUUID |UUID of the build result. Only set if the build is
using a build definition

|requestUUID |UUID of the build request. Only set if the build is using
a build definition.

|buildDefinitionId |UUID of the build definition being used by the
build. Only set if the build is using a build definition.

|repositoryAddress |Address of the RTC repository.

|buildEngineId |Name of the build engine associated with the build
request/result (if there is a build result). An RTC build engine is not
actually running, but some ant tasks need the engine id.

|buildEngineHostName |Host name of the Jenkins master or slave that the
build is running on.

|buildRequesterUserId |User id of the RTC user that requested the build
be started. Only set if the build is using a build definition

|personalBuild |True if the build is a personal build (requested from
RTC), otherwise, not set
|===

For instance, consider the scenario where you want to know if the RTC
build result that started this pipeline build is a personal build or
not.

. First create a Job parameter "personalBuild" type is String in the
Jenkins pipeline job and  set the default value to false.

[[TeamConcertPlugin-]]

{empty}2. Request a personal build in the RTC build definition
associated with the Jenkins job.

{empty}3. In your pipeline script, you can check whether the RTC build
is a personal build or not as follows

....
if ("${env.personalBuild}" == "true") {
   // Do something } else {   // Do something else}
}
// or

if ("${personalBuild}" == "true") {
   // Do something } else {   // Do something else}
}
....

{empty}4. To access the buildRequesterUserId property in your script,
define a new String parameter called "buildRequesterUserId" to the
Jenkins job and set the default value to an empty string.

{empty}5. Back in your pipeline script, you can access the property as

....
"${env.buildRequesterUserId}"
// or
"${buildRequesterUserId}"
....

____
Note : This is different from accessing personalBuild property of env
object after the checkout step runs. In that case, the personalBuild
property was repopulated by the checkout step and can be accessed only
through the $\{env} variable.  Here, the property is set by the RTC when
starting the Jenkins build.

[[TeamConcertPlugin-AccessingRTCEnvironmentVariablesinaPipelineJobaftercheckoutstepruns]]
=== Accessing RTC Environment Variables in a Pipeline Job after checkout step runs

_checkout_ step now returns a map that is populated by Team Concert
plugin. For instance, you can do something like the following to get the
required values into scmvars variable and access them using the syntax
"$\{scmvars.<rtc environment variable>}". For a list of built-in
properties exported to the environment, see
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Team+Concert+Plugin[this
section]

*checkoutstep*

----
def scmvars = checkout([$class: 'RTCScm'...])
----

Available in plugin version 1.2.0.5 and above and Jenkins 2.60 and above
with workflow-cps 2.40 and above. With the fix from
https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-26100[Issue 26100],

[[TeamConcertPlugin-Note1:]]
==== Note 1:

Even if you are not using the latest version of Team Concert Plugin,
with workflow-cps 2.40, the env object is repopulated every time the
checkout step runs. See
https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-42499[JENKINS-42499] and
this Jenkins developers
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/jenkinsci-dev/FM_Nx_K_v9g/4BzWXd3cAgAJ[forum
post].

Therefore, the issue reported in
https://jazz.net/jazz/web/projects/Rational%20Team%20Concert#action=com.ibm.team.workitem.viewWorkItem&id=370979[Defect
370979 - Environment variables for snapshot, build result UUID are null
if env object is accessed before running teamconcert checkout step, in a
pipeline script]  and the issue reported in this jazz.net
https://jazz.net/forum/questions/236515/team_scm_snapshotuuid-environment-variable-overwritten-when-loading-jenkins-pipeline-library[forum
post] are not seen anymore. As an example, after every checkout, you can
save the snapshot UUID value into a separate variable as follows

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
echo "${env.BUILD_NUMBER}"

 node {
   checkout([$class: 'RTCScm'...])
   // At this point, env contains RTC related environment variables from the first checkout
   def snapshotUUID1 = "${env.team_scm_snapshotUUID}"
   echo "${snapshotUUID1}"

   checkout([$class: 'RTCScm' ....])
   // At this point, env contains RTC related environment variables from the second checkout. The environment variables contributed by the first checkout are overwritten.
   def snapshotUUID2 = "${env.team_scm_snapshotUUID}"
   echo "${snapshotUUID2}"
 }
----

[[TeamConcertPlugin-Note2:]]
==== Note 2:

If you are using workflow-cps < 2.40, follow the workaround mentioned
below.

In a pipeline job the environment variables published by the Team
Concert Jenkins plugin is null if the env object is accessed once before
the RTC SCM checkout step. For instance, the following script would
return the UUID of the snapshot published by the Team Concert plugin.

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
node('master') {
    // run teamconcert scm step
    echo "${env.team_scm_snapshotUUID}"
 }
----

But in the script given below the env object is accessed once before
running the checkout step and hence accessing the snapshot UUID from the
env object returns null

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
echo "${env.BUILD_NUMBER}"
node('master') {
    // run teamconcert scm step
    echo "${env.team_scm_snapshotUUID}"
 }
----

Though the Team Concert plugin publishes the environment variables when
checkout is invoked, in pipeline scripts the env object once constructed
is not refreshed with any of the environment variables, published later.

If you run into issues accessing the environment variables published by
the Team Concert plugin, the suggested work around is to access the
RTCBuildResultAction object that is added to the build by the Team
Concert plugin. The following code returns the build properties stored
in RTCBuildResultAction object. This can be used in a pipeline script to
obtain snapshot UUID.

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
def action = currentBuild.build().getAction(com.ibm.team.build.internal.hjplugin.RTCBuildResultAction.class)
def buildProps = action.getBuildProperties()
println(buildProps['team_scm_snapshotUUID'])
----

Please note that if you invoke RTC SCM multiple times, then there will
be that many RTCBuildResultActions in the build. Therefore,
currentBuild.build().getActions(com.ibm.team.build.internal.hjplugin.RTCBuildResultAction.class)
should be used. The action added by the last invocation of RTC SCM
should be available at the end of the list. For instance, if there are
two RTCScm checkouts, the second RTCBuildResultAction can be accessed as
follows.

 +

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
def actions = currentBuild.build().getActions(com.ibm.team.build.internal.hjplugin.RTCBuildResultAction.class)
def buildProps = actions.get(1).getBuildProperties()
println(buildProps['team_scm_snapshotUUID'])
----

[[TeamConcertPlugin-WrappingthecodeinaGlobalSharedLibrary]]
==== Wrapping the code in a Global Shared Library

The above code cannot be directly used in a pipeline script. You can
wrap this code inside a method and add it to a Global Shared Library.
You can then call the method from your pipeline script.

If you are already using a Global Shared Library in your environment,
add the following code in a file called rtcutils.groovy and place the
file under the *vars* directory,

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
 def getSnapshotUUID(actionNum) { // The n'th RTCBuildResultAction.
    def actions = currentBuild.build().getActions(com.ibm.team.build.internal.hjplugin.RTCBuildResultAction.class)
    if (actions != null && actions.size() > 0 && actionNum > 0 && actionNum <= actions.size()) {
        def buildProps = actions.get(actionNum-1).getBuildProperties()
        return (buildProps['team_scm_snapshotUUID'])
    } 
    return null
}
----

Then, in your pipeline script, you can write the following to get the
snapshotUUID of the checkout step.

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
@Library('your-shared-library')_

node {
   checkout([$class: 'RTCScm'...])

   def snapshotUUID = rtcutils.getSnapshotUUID(2) // pass 2 if the shared library is fetched from RTC, otherwise pass 1
   echo "${snapshotUUID}"
}
----

 +

If you don't have Global Shared Library in your environment, consult
https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/[https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries]
on how to create and access a shared library in your pipeline script.
Note that if you use RTC for hosting the Global Shared Library, then
there will be a RTCBuildResultAction added to the build at the point
where the library is brought into the pipeline script.

[[TeamConcertPlugin-SymbolicLinksupport]]
=== Symbolic Link support

RTC support for symbolic links requires one or two additional libraries
(.dll/.so files).

. RTC file system natives
. Eclipse file system natives

The reason is Java 6 and earlier doesn't have support for
creating/looking at properties of symbolic links. Java 7 has symbolic
link support that works on linux, but on Windows there are some
limitations when creating links (if the target has not yet been created
the type is defaulted to file which is not good if its a directory). If
you are running Linux and can use Java 7 you only need the Eclipse
natives. Otherwise, you will need both the RTC and Eclipse natives.

In the Build engine directory (<your RTC build install
directory>\buildengine\eclipse\plugins), look for (or equivalent jars
for your platform/release).

. `+com.ibm.team.filesystem.client_3.1.600.v20130415_0257.jar+` (RTC
file system natives)
. `+org.eclipse.core.filesystem.win32.x86_1.1.201.R36x_v20100727-0745.jar+`
(Eclipse file system natives)

From the com.ibm.team.filesystem.client jar you want to extract
`+winfsnatives.dll+` (`+libfsnatives.so+` on linux). Take all the
.dll/.so files from the org.eclipse.core.filesystem jar. Place them
directly in a directory (eg. c:\natives\winfsnatives.dll).

When you start Jenkins, we need to tell java about the directory so that
it can load the libraries from it. To this, you can add the directory to
the search path. +
Change the `+PATH+` variable on Windows or the `+LD_LIBRARY_PATH+`
variable on linux prior to starting Jenkins. Alternatively, you can also
specify it when starting Java through the `+-Djava.library.path+`
setting. +
eg.
`+java -Djava.library.path="c:\natives;%Path%" -jar jenkins-1.509.1.war+`

If you are running on Windows, you need to be sure that you have
permission to create symbolic links. The
https://jazz.net/library/article/970/[Symbolic links article] in the
jazz.net library describes how.

Note: If you are running your jenkins builds on slaves and the symbolic
links fail to load, then the native libraries should be included in the
JVM library path of slaves too.

[[TeamConcertPlugin-LoadRulesSupport]]
=== Load Rules Support

. When a jenkins build is configured with an RTC build definition, the
component load rules specified in the RTC build definition, if any, will
be applied when loading the jenkins build
workspace. https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSCP65_6.0.3/com.ibm.team.build.doc/topics/r_scm_build_loadrules.html[Component
load rules in builds] describes how to specify load rules in a build
definition.
. When a jenkins build is configured with an RTC repository workspace,
stream, or snapshot load rules can be specified by setting the load
policy field to "Load components by using a load rule file".
. [.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .confluence-embedded-manual-size]#image:docs/images/Load-Using-Load-Rule-File.png[image,height=250]#
. To configure load policy in a pipeline build, set the "loadPolicy"
field to one of - "useComponentLoadConfig", "useLoadRules", or
"useDynamicLoadRules".
.. When loadPolicy is set to useComponentLoadConfig, you can either
choose to load all components or exclude some components by setting the
value for "componentLoadConfig" to either "loadAllComponents" or
"excludeSomeComponents".
. The load policy field for RTC build definition can be set only using
the 6.0.5 RTC client.
. Component load rules can also be specified through dynamic load rules
extension. For more details refer
https://jazz.net/wiki/bin/view/Main/DynamicLoadRulesJenkinsPlugin[DynamicLoadRulesJenkinsPlugin].
Dynamic load rules feature is supported across all build configurations
- build definition, repository workspace, stream, and snapshot.
. In build definition configuration, when load rules are configured in
the build definition and dynamic load rules are also provided, dynamic
load rules take precedence over the component load rules.
. Note that the till 1.2.0.4 the behavior of load rules in Jenkins
builds, when using the component load rules specified in RTC build
definition or the load rules generated by the dynamic load rules
extension, is different from how eclipse client enforces the load rules.
Say, you have a load rules file that loads some but not all of the
components in a workspace. This load rules file when used to load a
workspace in the eclipse client, will result in loading of only those
components specified in the load rules file. When the same load rules
file is configured in an RTC build definition, all components from the
workspace, including those not specified in the load rules file, are
loaded; those components for which load rules are specified are loaded
according to the specified load rules, all the other components are
loaded as is. [.ph .cmd]#The [.ph .uicontrol]#Components to exclude#
option, in the RTC build definition can be used to restrict which
components are loaded during the build - for more details refer
https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSCP65_6.0.3/com.ibm.team.build.doc/topics/tcreatebuilddefinition.html[Creating
RTC build definitions].#
. [.ph .cmd]##From 1.2.0.4 the behavior of load rules in Jenkins builds
is at par with RTC SCM. So, only those components for which load rules
are specified will be loaded, according to those rules; all the other
components for which load rules are not specified will not be loaded. To
maintain backward compatibility in Jenkins builds configured with an RTC
build definition, old load rules behavior will be enforced unless the
load policy field in the build definition is set to use load
rules. ##[.ph .cmd]## ##[.ph .cmd]# +

[[TeamConcertPlugin-Knownlimitations:]]
== Known limitations:

. In the version 1.2.0.0, polling is not supported for stream and
snapshot build configurations, when "avoid using toolkit on master
(experimental)" is checked.
. In the version 1.2.0.0 temporary workspaces are created to support
loading from a stream and snapshot. Teamconcert plugin deletes the
temporary workspaces when the completes. These temporary workspaces
could be left behind in case of network issue during the build. The
temporary workspaces can be located by searching for workspaces that
starts with the prefix "HJP_".

password file) , it will continue to run but these fields are read only.
Any changes will require credentials going forward.  Using the
Credentials plugin offers more flexibility and solves some issues.
.. Multiple credentials can be defined and used in multiple jobs

. When builds are started within RTC, the server will manage the
lifecycle of the build result by periodically polling Jenkins to
determine if the build is completed. With RTC 5.0, build definitions
support the boolean property
`+com.ibm.rational.connector.hudson.queueOnly+`. When used in
conjunction with this release of the plugin, the plugin will terminate
the RTC build result when the build completes (just as it does when the
build is started in Jenkins). If a lot of builds are started from within
RTC, this will be more efficient. Requires RTC version 5.0 or later.
https://jazz.net/jazz/resource/itemName/com.ibm.team.workitem.WorkItem/308749[Work

. New option to use rest service calls to communicate with the RTC
Server when performing configuration, polling and build result
management (as opposed to the build toolkit). This means if all the jobs

. The RTC build toolkit is used perform build related tasks within
Jenkins Master and Slave processes (as opposed to using a command line
client). The RTC related tasks include validating the configuration,
polling and working with the RTC build result as well as performing the
Accept and Checkout phases of the build.

. The environment variable buildResultUUID is a parameter that is
supplied to the Jenkins job when the build started from RTC. It was
sometimes also being updated (contributed by this plugin) even if the
build was started in Jenkins. In order to better support building
multiple projects with the Multiple SCM plugin, the environment variable
will not be updated by this plugin. The build result UUID is still
available from the RTCBuildResultUUID regardless of where the build was

https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Credentials+Plugin[Credentials
Plugin] is now used for storing the user ID and password. For an
existing global configuration and jobs, the user ID and password (or
password file) fields will be read-only. If a job is using a password
file and needs to change a password, the password file contents can be
replaced. Otherwise, to update the password the job will need to start
using credentials. If this not acceptable, the plugin can work in the
old mode by setting the system/environment property:
com.ibm.team.build.credential.edit=true.

. On Linux, a build definition with a load directory starting with "/"
(i.e. "/any/folder") used to be interpreted as a relative path, but is
now correctly interpreted as an absolute path.  So, any build definition
relying on the previous behavior need only prefix the load directory
with a "." (i.e. "./any/folder").
