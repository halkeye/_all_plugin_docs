Block build when upstream/downstream project is building. Optional final
projects may be given.

[[BlockBuildFinalProjectPlugin-Summary]]
== Summary

This plug-in allows a project to block when upstream or downstream
projects are building. Jenkins already provides this functionality
built-in, but it blocks on the entire pipeline. This plug-in allows an
optional final project to be specified. This allows the project to block
on part of the pipeline instead of the entire pipeline.

When configuring a project, the following options are available when
this plugin is installed:

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/block-build-final-project.jpg[image]#
