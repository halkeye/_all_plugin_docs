This plugin allows you to configure a mapping between usernames and
email addresses. Then when plugins try to resolve a username to an email
address, it will resolve using the provided address.

[[MailMapResolver-Globalconfiguration]]
=== Global configuration

The only configuration for this plugin is done via the global
configuration. The map is the same syntax as a Java properties file, so
anything that must be escaped for a Java properties file must be escaped
in the user map.

You can provide multiple usernames per line by separating them with a
comma in the key of the property (escaping may be required).
