* Users of this plugin are encouraged to migrate their jobs to
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Pipeline+Plugin[Pipeline
Plugin], so that their jobs will be specified in pipeline code that can
be checked into an SCM, all without using the SCM Sync confguration
plugin.
* Users of this plugin are also encouraged to use the
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Configuration+as+Code+Plugin[Configuration
as Code Plugin] to specify the configuration of their Jenkins server in
a file which can be checked into an SCM, all without using the SCM Sync
configuration plugin.

[[SCMSyncconfigurationplugin-Introduction]]
== Introduction

Syncs configuration files to a SCM repository and tracks changes done to
them

SCM Sync Configuration Jenkins/Hudson plugin is aimed at 2 main features
:

* Keep sync'ed your config.xml (and other ressources) jenkins/hudson
files with a SCM repository
* Track changes (and author) made on every file with commit messages

ATTN: https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-32124[JENKINS-32124] details
an issue with the 0.0.9 version causing the UI to appear blank after
Jenkins restart in both Windows and Linux environments.

[[SCMSyncconfigurationplugin-Installation]]
== Installation

To install SCM Sync Configuration Plugin, Go to the "plugin management"
section in the administration Panel. +
Latest released version will be available. Install it from there (you
should need to restart Jenkins/Hudson after that).

To verify that the plugin is well installed, go to the Administration
panel, then in the "System configuration" section : you should notice a
"SCM Sync Configuration" section : +
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/Jenkins_-_scm-sync-configuration_-_Enter_your_synchronized_SCM2.png[image]#

[[SCMSyncconfigurationplugin-Usage]]
== Usage

On the System configuration panel (seen above), you'll be prompted for a
SCM type (as of this writing, Subversion or Git) and a repository URL
for your SCM type.

When you'll complete this form section, and validate the form, the SCM
Sync Configuration will compute every configuration file he is able to
synchronize, and commit them, for initialization, on your SCM
repository. +
*Warning* : This first step can take a few minutes !

Once initialized, every time you'll submit a configuration view that can
be sync'ed by the SCM Sync Configuration plugin, you'll be prompted for
a comment that will be put on the commit message on your SCM
Repository. +
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/Jenkins_-_scm-sync-configuration_-_Comment_prompt2.png[image]#

For now, supported configuration files are the following ones :

* Job configuration files (/jobs/*/config.xml)
* Global Jenkins/Hudson system configuration file (/config.xml)
* Basic plugin configuration files (/hudson*.xml,
/scm-sync-configuration.xml)
* User-defined manual includes (see
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/SCM+Sync+Config+shared+additional+includes[this
dedicated page])

But more default configuration files are planned ! (see the Product
Backlog for further informations)

On every pages, you will have some scm sync config status at the bottom
of the page, saying if something went wrong : +

Warning

[.aui-icon .aui-icon-small .aui-iconfont-warning .confluence-information-macro-icon]#
#

To use a Git server with SSH, you have to accept the server SSH key
before using the plugin (same for using Git in Jenkins jobs).

==== Improvements

* *User defined files being
committed* (https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-8225[JENKINS-8225]
which implies
https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-14642[JENKINS-14642],
https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-14812[JENKINS-14812],
https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-15018[JENKINS-15018]) :
Now, you can add user-defined custom paths to synchronize on the system
page. Don't hesitate to
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/SCM+Sync+Config+shared+additionnal+includes[share
yours] on the dedicated page.
* *Commits should be made asynchronously*
(https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-14214[JENKINS-14214] which
implies, I think,
https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-9166[JENKINS-9166] and
https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-10967[JENKINS-10967]) :
now, commiting files is not blocking but postponed into an asynchronous
queue. This will lead in performance improvements on large jenkins
instance + lower the chance to have concurrent modifications on files
(file content to commit is saved).
* *Bulk transactional commit*
(https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-13613[JENKINS-13613]) :
before v0.0.6, 1 file modified = 1 commit. Prior to 0.0.6, if during an
HTTP request, you modify several files, they will all be committed into
a single commit. +
It should greatly improve the commit readability, and lead to atomic
commits. +
Note that "automatic" (ie "non manual") file changes will remain
commited one by one (this is difficult to identify a "system-wide
transaction").
* *Allowing to reload configuration files from SCM* : added an hyperling
on global Jenkins configuration page for doing this
* Commit messages improved
(https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-14568[JENKINS-14568]) :
now, deleted / renamed / updated files are labeled into the commit
"technical part" of the message

[[SCMSyncconfigurationplugin-Bugs]]
==== Bugs

* https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-14582[JENKINS-14582] :

root)

[[SCMSyncconfigurationplugin-KnownBugsonthisrelease]]
==== Known Bugs on this release

* If you're using Git, job rename won't work as expected. This is
related to
https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-15128[JENKINS-15128] which
relies on http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/SCM-694[a bug in maven scm
api]. Once the bug will be fixed in maven scm api, I'll align on it and
it will fix the problem in the plugin.
* A regression has been identified
(https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-15221[JENKINS-15221])
concerning the initial check in when jenkins starts. +
In previous version, if some files in jenkins_home were not present in
the scm, these files were added. In 0.0.6 it isn't the case and should
considered as a major regression.
