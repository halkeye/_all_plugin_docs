The CodeSonar plugin for Jenkins is developed by Praqma and sponsored by
http://www.grammatech.com/[GrammaTech, Inc]. It is maintained in the
scope of http://www.josra.org/[Joint Open Source Roadmap Alliance]
(JOSRA).

[[CodeSonarPlugin-Introduction]]
== Introduction

The CodeSonar plugin collects project analysis data from a designated
CodeSonar hub.

* Historical data about CodeSonar warning counts and code size is
presented in the Job Dashboard.
* The plugin can be configured to change the build result if the
CodeSonar analysis results meet specified conditions.

The following documentation cites relevant sections in the CodeSonar
manual. These citations take the form +
MANUAL: Subject > ... > Page Title +
where Subject > .... > Page Title denotes a navigation path through the
CodeSonar manual table of contents.

[[CodeSonarPlugin-AboutCodeSonar®]]
=== About CodeSonar ^®^

http://www.grammatech.com/codesonar[CodeSonar], GrammaTech's flagship
static analysis software, identifies programming bugs that can result in
system crashes, memory corruption, leaks, data races, and security
vulnerabilities.

By analyzing both source code and binaries, CodeSonar empowers
developers to eliminate the most costly and hard-to-find defects early
in the application development lifecycle.

=== [#CodeSonarPlugin-cso_ready .confluence-anchor-link .conf-macro .output-inline]## ##A. Make sure CodeSonar is ready to analyze your software

Work through the following steps to make sure that CodeSonar is in a
suitable state to be invoked by your Jenkins job.

. Make sure that the path to `+/codesonar/bin+` is in the `+PATH+` of
the user who is running Jenkins.
* Otherwise, your `+codesonar analyze+` command will have to specify the
path to the `+codesonar+` executable.
. Start the CodeSonar hub to use for recording the analysis results (if
it is not already running). +
MANUAL: How CodeSonar Works > CodeSonar Structure > Hub > Starting a
Hub +
The remainder of these instructions will refer to the hub location as
_host:port_.
. Establish a project directory and project name for the CodeSonar
project that will be built and analyzed.
* If you have previously analyzed your software with CodeSonar, you can
use the existing project infrastructure.
* Otherwise, choose a project directory, and create the directory if it
does not already exist. +
In either case, make sure the project directory has a suitable location
and read/write settings. If Jenkins is running with different OS
credentials to your own, remember to take this into account.
* Use the same project directory and project name every time you perform
the CodeSonar build/analysis for a given project.
* The project directory should not be deleted at the end of the build:
the CodeSonar GUI needs to interact with its contents, and incremental
builds need information that is stored there.
** Make sure that the project directory is in a location where Jenkins
will not automatically delete it after running the job. For example, it
is probably a good idea to locate it outside the Jenkins workspace.
** Similarly, take steps to ensure that your other build tools will not
delete the project directory.
* Set the project directory permissions to allow the Jenkins process to
read and write to it. +
The remainder of these instructions will refer to the project directory
as _projdir_ and the project name as _proj-name_.
. If the project directory does not include a general project
configuration file (for example, because you just created the directory
in the previous step), create one now:
+

MANUAL: Using CodeSonar > Building and Analyzing Projects > Options,

parameter settings (unless the factory settings are suitable). +
MANUAL: Using CodeSonar > Building and Analyzing Projects > Options,
Preferences, and Configuration Files > Compiler-Independent
Configuration File Parameters for CodeSonar +
In particular:
* You may wish to specify one or more `+CFLAGS_APPEND+` rules.
* If you are performing a clean build every time, set
`+INCREMENTAL_BUILD=No+`.
. Make sure there is a CodeSonar launch daemon running on the analysis
machine, with the same owner as the Jenkins process. +
MANUAL: How CodeSonar Works > Build and Analysis > cslaunchd: The
CodeSonar Launch Daemon
* _If the analysis machine is running Windows_, check to see whether
there is a `+cslaunchd+` service on the analysis machine, with the same
owner as the Jenkins process. If not, set one up. +
MANUAL: Using CodeSonar > Building and Analyzing Projects > Continuous

Note that if Jenkins is running as a service, its owner will usually be

the following steps.

. View the Job Dashboard for the Jenkins job that is building your
software.
. Click *Configure* to open the *Job Configurations* page.
. [#CodeSonarPlugin-def_hub .confluence-anchor-link .conf-macro .output-inline]##

CodeSonar analysis invocation and to configure the CodeSonar plugin
later:
.. Make sure *This build is parameterized* is selected.
.. Under *This build is parameterized*, click *Add Parameter*, then
select *String Parameter* from the menu that pops up.
.. Jenkins will display a set of fields for setting up your new
parameter. Fill them out as follows.
* Name: `+HUB+`
* Default Value: the location (_host:port_) of your CodeSonar hub. For
example, `+alexhubmachine:7340+`.
* Description: you may want to enter a short description to remind
yourself why you have this variable.
. [#CodeSonarPlugin-def_projname .confluence-anchor-link .conf-macro .output-inline]##
##Use the same process to define a `+PROJNAME+` parameter whose value
matches your established CodeSonar project name (_proj-name_). +

|Project Language |Editing the Build Section
|C, C++ a|
For every existing build step that involves C/C++ compilation, edit the
build step to incorporate the CodeSonar build/analysis command. If the
current build step or steps contain one command that involves C/C++
compilation, this will involve constructing a single
`+codesonar analyze+` command. Otherwise there are two possible
approaches:

* Accumulate components into a CodeSonar project by constructing a
`+codesonar build+` command for each software build command that
involves C/C++ compilation, then add a final `+codesonar analyze+`
command to analyze the project. +
_or_
* Replace the text of the build step or steps with an invocation of a
shell script or batch file with equivalent contents, then construct a
single `+codesonar analyze+` command based on that invocation. +
 +
The `+codesonar analyze+` command must include the `+-foreground+`
option. +

|Mixed Java and C/C++ a|
Combine the approaches for Java-only and C/C++-only projects:

.. Edit the build steps to incorporate a `+codesonar build+` command for
each software build command that involves C/C++ compilation.
.. Add a new build step that executes `+codesonar build+` on any Java
bytecode produced by earlier build steps.
.. Add a new, final build step that invokes `+codesonar analyze+` to
analyze the project. +

Once your Jenkins job is correctly invoking the CodeSonar analysis, you
can apply the CodeSonar plugin to collect analysis information from the
hub.

. Go back to *Job Configurations* page for the Jenkins job that is
building your software.
. Under *Post-build Actions*, click *Add post-build action*, and select
*CodeSonar* from the menu that pops up.
* If CodeSonar is not a menu option, the plugin may not be installed.
. Jenkins will display fields for you to configure this application of
the plugin.
.. Select the protocol used by your hub from the *Protocol* menu: either
`+http+` or `+https+`.
.. Enter `+${HUB+`} in the *hub address* field.
.. Enter `+${PROJNAME+`} in the *Project name* field.
.. Click the *Add* button next to the *Credentials* field, then fill in
the *Add Credentials* form that opens and click *Add*.
... Set *Kind* to "Username with password" or "Certificate".

options.
.. [Optional] If you want to configure one or more "CodeSonar
conditions", see the descriptions
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/CodeSonar+Plugin#CodeSonarPlugin-cso_cond[below].
. Click *Save*.
* The list of links at the left hand side of the Job Dashboard will now
include a *Latest CodeSonar Analysis* link. This navigates to the
CodeSonar GUI Analysis page for the most recently executed analysis of
this project.
. Check that everything is working properly:
.. Click *Build with Parameters*, check that the parameter settings are
correct, and click *Build*. +
Jenkins will execute the updated job.
.. Check that the Jenkins job executed successfully, and check the job's
*Console Output* to ensure that the build proceeded as you expected.
* If necessary, click *Configure* and adjust your edits, and make any
other changes necessary to get your job running correctly.
. Notice that the dashboard now contains charts of "Total number of
warnings" and "Lines of Code" (if it doesn't, reload the page). These
charts represent CodeSonar analysis history for this project.

Where conditions are concerned with increase with respect to
a[#CodeSonarPlugin-prev_analysis .confluence-anchor-link .conf-macro .output-inline]##
##"previous analysis", the previous analysis is considered to be the
CodeSonar analysis invoked by the previous Jenkins build. Note that
there may be more recent analyses on the CodeSonar hub if they were
invoked from outside Jenkins. The first analysis of the project has no
"previous analysis": in this case, the increase-based conditions are
considered to be unsatisfied. Warning count for these conditions is
determined with respect to the default warning visibility setting for
the hub user account whose
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/CodeSonar+Plugin#CodeSonarPlugin-credentials[credentials]
you have supplied.

You can specify multiple conditions, including multiple conditions of a
single type. When multiple conditions are specified they are all checked
and the "worst" marking from the set of satisfied conditions is applied.
That is:

* If any satisfied condition specifies "Failed", the plugin will mark
the build as "Failed".
* If no satisfied condition specifies "Failed" but at least one
satisfied condition specifies "Unstable", the plugin will mark the build
as "Unstable".

[[CodeSonarPlugin-ConfigurationExample]]
==== Configuration Example

With this configuration, the plugin will mark the build as "Unstable" if
the CodeSonar analysis produces one or two red alerts, but "Failed" if
there are three or more.
