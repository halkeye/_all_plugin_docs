This plugin calculates the following metrics for all of your builds once
installed:

* Mean Time To Failure (MTTF)
* Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR)
* Standard Deviation of Build Times

The calculated metrics are displayed in a table on each jobs page
showing the metric for the last 7 days, last 30 days and all time. Â The
table looks something like this: +
