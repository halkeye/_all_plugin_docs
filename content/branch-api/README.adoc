[[BranchAPIPlugin-BranchAPIPlugin]]
== Branch API Plugin

This plugin provides an API for multiple branch based projects.

 +
The following concepts are provided:

* Multibranch projects: projects consisting in a group of several
projects, one for each defined branch.
* Organizational folders: a folder-like collection of Multibranch
projects, one per repository.
* Branch properties: add additional information linked to the branch,
which can then be used to take decisions. Some properties are provided:

* {blank}
** Do not trigger builds for branch.
** Do not trigger builds for organizational folder.
** Override triggering behaviour for multibranch project or
organizational folder.
** Untrusted author.
** Limit builds for a branch to a certain rate.
** Discard old builds for branch.

[[BranchAPIPlugin-Debughooksforevents]]
== Debug hooks for events

If you have to try and diagnose issues with events or indexing, the
following information may be of assistance:

Jobs triggered by SCM Events try to capture their origin.

The origin is available as a tool-tip on the build cause: +
  
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .confluence-embedded-manual-size]#image:docs/images/Screen_Shot_2017-03-16_at_14.11.57.png[image,width=300]#

This can be very helpful to quickly identify where events that trigger
builds are coming from.

More detailed event processing information is available from the event
logs. +
 

By default, the CloudBees Folders plugin will only retain the logs of
the last scan / index. If you are having issues with scanning /
indexing, it can help to turn on the retention with the system
property `+com.cloudbees.hudson.plugins.folder.computed.FolderComputation.BACKUP_LOG_COUNT+`
(note that you can write directly to that field using the System Groovy
Console, so you can change the value on a running system without a
restart)

The Multi-branch projects will log the initial arrival of events and any
routing decisions in
the `+$JENKINS_HOME/logs/jenkins.branch.MultiBranchProject.log+` file
(which will be rolled every 32kB, limit of 5 files)

* Once an event has been routed to a specific Multi-branch project, the
responsibility for logging the event will belong with that Multi-branch
project and will be stored in the
`+$JENKINS_HOME/jobs/$PATH_TO_PROJECT/indexing/events.log+` (which will
be rolled every 150kB, limit of `+BACKUP_LOG_COUNT+` files)

The Organization folder projects will log the initial arrival of events
and any routing decisions in
the `+$JENKINS_HOME/logs/jenkins.branch.OrganizationFolder.log+`
file (which will be rolled every 32kB, limit of 5 files)

* Once an event has been routed to a specific Organization folder
project, the responsibility for logging the event will belong with that
Organization folder project and will be stored in the
`+$JENKINS_HOME/jobs/$PATH_TO_PROJECT/computation/events.log+` (which
will be rolled every 150kB, limit of `+BACKUP_LOG_COUNT+` files)

#  Adds an extension point for organization folders that enabled the
customization of the children of the organization folder on every
organization folder scan. There are three implementations provided: +
** Child Health metrics which allows controlling the health metrics that
the child multibranch projects will use. Previous behaviour was to
always configure just the default health metrics relevant to a
multi-branch project.
** Child Scan Triggers which enabled the customization of the scan
triggers for the child multibranch projects. Previous behaviour was to
initially configure this to once per day and never update it. The new
behaviour will now enforce the triggers defined in Child Scan Triggers
for the organization folder.  +
image:docs/images/warning.svg[(warning)]**NOTE **if
you have been using some custom hack to change the multibranch scan
triggers after initial creation, that hack is no longer needed... and in
fact it will now cease to work
** Child Orphaned Item Strategy which allows the child multibranch
projects to have a different orphaned item strategy from the parent
organization folder. By default this property will use the _Inherited_
strategy which retains the existing behaviour but you can configure a
different strategy if you want branches to be retained on a different
schedule from repositories.

[[BranchAPIPlugin-Version2.0.0-beta-1(Dev16,2016)]]
=== Version 2.0.0-beta-1 (Dev 16, 2016)

* Available in the experimental update center only
* Pick up API changes from SCM API 2.0 (requires SCM API 2.0.1-beta-1
and if you have either of the github-branch-source or
bitbucket-branch-source plugins you must upgrade them to at least
2.0.0-beta-1)

[[BranchAPIPlugin-Version1.11.1(Nov04,2016)]]
=== Version 1.11.1 (Nov 04, 2016)

* https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-39520[JENKINS-39520]
Error when dynamically installing multiple branch source plugins.

[[BranchAPIPlugin-Version1.11(Sep23,2016)]]
=== Version 1.11 (Sep 23, 2016)

* https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-34564[JENKINS-34564]
Branch projects now get custom workspace paths inside the node’s
`+workspace+` directory, capped by default at 80 characters and using
only ASCII letters, numbers, and simple punctuation (in particular, no
`+%+`).
* https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-37219[JENKINS-37219]
Added a job property for overriding the implicit branch indexing trigger
flag, allowing a multibranch `+Jenkinsfile+` to customize its own
triggering behavior after the initial build.

[.aui-icon .aui-icon-small .aui-iconfont-error .confluence-information-macro-icon]#
#

Some projects running external processes that cannot handle even
moderately long pathnames will not work with the new default workspace
locations. The system property
`+jenkins.branch.WorkspaceLocatorImpl.PATH_MAX+` may be set to `+0+` to
restore the previous behavior (which will then break some processes
which cannot handle funny characters, or projects using long branch
names etc.). The default value is 80; values as low as 54 (but no lower)
are possible. When feasible, fix the external process to be more robust,
or on Windows use

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
\\?\
----

as a prefix before the remote filesystem root.

Another workaround in Pipeline scripts is to use the `+ws+` step with an
absolute pathname. You can then choose any path, and concurrent builds
will still get distinct workspaces automatically; but you are on the
hook for finding a _valid_ path on the node, unrelated projects might
overwrite each other’s workspaces between builds (reducing beneficial
caches of SCM checkouts and the like), and the custom workspaces will
not be automatically deleted if the branch project is deleted. The first
problem could be avoided by using a pathname like `+../custom+` rather
than an absolute path.

Note that the `+sshagent+` Pipeline step
(https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/SSH+Agent+Plugin[SSH Agent
Plugin]) when used inside an `+Image.inside+` block
(https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Docker+Pipeline+Plugin[Docker
Pipeline Plugin]) will not currently work when the workspace path
exceeds 108 characters, due to a poor choice of constant in most Linux
kernels:
https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-36997[JENKINS-36997].

A full fix should probably come in
https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-2111[JENKINS-2111] for all
project types.

there are some SCM providers
