[[P4Plugin-Overview]]
== Overview

P4 Plugin for Jenkins manages Perforce Helix workspaces; synchronising
code and polling/triggering builds. 

The P4 Plugin has been fully tested against Helix P4D release version
2015.1

The plugin supports:

* Credential authentication
* Client Workspace management
* Synchronisation behaviour
* Polling and filtered builds
* External review tools (Swarm)
* Change-list browsing
* Labeling builds (Tagging)
* External repository browsers (P4Web, Swarm)
* Submit assets back to Perforce Helix (Publish)

[[P4Plugin-Requirements]]
=== Requirements

* Jenkins 1.642.3 or greater.
* Helix Versioning Engine 2015.1 or greater.
* Minimum Protection of 'open' for the Jenkins user.
* If you wish to use the Review Build feature you will need Swarm. 
* Swarm 2015.1 or greater.

[[P4Plugin-Issues]]
=== Issues

All issues are managed on the
JIRA https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=141[Agile
Board], when reporting an issue please set the Component to `p4-plugin`
(not `Perforce`).

[[P4Plugin-Limitations]]
=== Limitations

* Some parameters are not available during Polling.  As a result these
variables will not get expanded leading to unexpected results (e.g. new
workspaces being created resulting in continuous polling).  Jenkins job
and multi configuration parameters should be expand, but custom or
parameterised build variables are unlikely to be available.
