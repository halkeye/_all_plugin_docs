This plugin integrates http://darcs.net/[Darcs] version control system
to Jenkins. The plugin requires the Darcs binary (darcs) to be installed
on the target machine.

 +
With this plugin, you can designate a Darcs repository as the "upstream"
repository. Every build will then run "darcs pull" to bring the tip of
this upstream repository. In a similar manner, polling will check if the
upstream repository contains any new changes, and use that as the
triggering condition of the new build.
