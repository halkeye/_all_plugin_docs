This is a Jenkins plugin which updates issues in Atlassian JIRA (by
changing their status, adding a comment or updating fields) as part of a
Jenkins job.

Jira-Issue-Updater-Plugin can search for issues to update using a
flexible, user-definable JQL which can contain arbitrary variable values
from the Jenkins Build, and update the contents of the JIRA.

The plugin can be called during a Post Build Step and/or as a Post Build
Action.

Common Use Cases:

* Update a JIRA when a build passes/fails, for example to keep an audit
trail in JIRA
* Update Fixed Versions in JIRA
* Fail a build if a JIRA cannot be found 

[[JiraIssueUpdaterPlugin-What'snew]]
== What's new

[[JiraIssueUpdaterPlugin-Version1.20]]
=== Version 1.20

Version 1.19 failed due to using out of date build settings. Updated and
re-released as Version 1.20.

Changes:

* Added fixed versions
* Use up to date build settings, deal with FindBugs and Javadoc issues

[[JiraIssueUpdaterPlugin-Version1.18]]
=== Version 1.18

Changes:

* Added version management

[[JiraIssueUpdaterPlugin-Version1.17]]
=== Version 1.17

Changed to use the REST interface (SOAP has been deprecated and is being
removed). The current functionality is:

* JIRA selection using JQL
* Add a JIRA comment (supports variable substitution)
* Update a field with a value (supports variable substitution)
* Set a workflow status

Note: "Fixed Versions" removed temporarily

Added "Post Build Action"

[[JiraIssueUpdaterPlugin-Version1.3]]
=== Version 1.3

Added support for build parameters and environment variables.

Use e.g

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
$BUILD_NUMBER
----

and not:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
${BUILD_NUMBER}
----

and then they will get replaced for any of the below:

* jira comment
* jql
* workflow action name

[[JiraIssueUpdaterPlugin-Whentouseit]]
== When to use it

* in case you would like to announce or just log in Jira that the
deployment of certain fixes / issues the acceptance server has completed
(this makes sense if you already use Jenkins to deploy your applications
to the acceptance web/app server).
* in case you would like Jenkins to update multiple issues when a new
version of one of your projects is released (this makes sense if you use
the "maven release plugin" and you trigger it from Jenkins).
* in case you would like to progress multiple Jira issues in the
workflow (bulk changing the status of multiple Jira issues) and/or add a
comment to issues after a Jenkins job has successfully completed.

[[JiraIssueUpdaterPlugin-Howtouseit]]
== How to use it

After installing this plugin you will find it:

* under the 'Add build step' option (in case of a free-style or
multi-configuration project build jobs) 
* under the 'Add pre-build Step' & 'Add post-build step' options (in
case of Maven project build jobs)

[[JiraIssueUpdaterPlugin-Inputs]]
=== Inputs

* the Jira SOAP URL (e.g.
http://something.com/rpc/soap/jirasoapservice-v2)
* the Jira username and password to be used to connect to Jira
* a JQL query selecting the issues to be updated (e.g. project="JENKINS"
and status="Pending deploy")
* the name of the workflow action to be executed (not mandatory)
* the message to be added to each issue (not mandatory)
