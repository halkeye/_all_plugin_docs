Exports the name and message for a git tag as environment variables
during a build.If the revision checked out during a build has a git tag
associated with it, its name will be exported during the build as the
`+GIT_TAG_NAME+` environment variable. +
If a message was specified when creating the tag (e.g. via
`+git tag -m "..."+`), then that message will also be exported during
the build, as the `+GIT_TAG_MESSAGE+` environment variable.

If the revision has more than one tag associated with it, only the most
recent tag will be taken into account. However, if your refspec includes
"refs/tags" — i.e. builds are only triggered when certain tag names or
patterns are matched — then the exact tag name that triggered the build
will be used, even if it's not the most recent tag for this commit.

You can optionally choose the "use most recent tag" option, which will
then export the tag name and message from the nearest tag in the history
of the commit being built, if any.

[[GitTagMessagePlugin-Usage]]
== Usage

[[GitTagMessagePlugin-Freestyle]]
=== Freestyle

Under the Source Control Management section in your job configuration,
if you have selected "Git", then there should be a section labelled
"Additional Behaviours".

Click "Add" and select "Export git tag and message as environment
variables".

If you are also using the "Create a tag for every build" behaviour, use
the drag-and-drop handles to ensure that it happens *after* the "Export
git tag and message as environment variables" behaviour. Otherwise, the
git tag message will likely end up being the auto-generated Jenkins tag
message, e.g. "Jenkins Build #1".

[[GitTagMessagePlugin-Pipeline]]
=== Pipeline

Currently, this plugin does not work in Pipeline, as plugins can't
contribute environment variables in the same way as in Freestyle.

However, until this plugin is fixed, you could use these Scripted
Pipeline functions to achieve pretty much the same result:

// Example usage
node {
    git url: 'https://github.com/jenkinsci/git-tag-message-plugin'
    env.GIT_TAG_NAME = gitTagName()
    env.GIT_TAG_MESSAGE = gitTagMessage()
}

/** @return The tag name, or `null` if the current commit isn't a tag. */
String gitTagName() {
    commit = getCommit()
    if (commit) {
        desc = sh(script: "git describe --tags ${commit}", returnStdout: true)?.trim()
        if (isTag(desc)) {
            return desc
        }
    }
    return null
}

/** @return The tag message, or `null` if the current commit isn't a tag. */
String gitTagMessage() {
    name = gitTagName()
    msg = sh(script: "git tag -n10000 -l ${name}", returnStdout: true)?.trim()
    if (msg) {
        return msg.substring(name.size()+1, msg.size())
    }
    return null
}

String getCommit() {
    return sh(script: 'git rev-parse HEAD', returnStdout: true)?.trim()
}

@NonCPS
boolean isTag(String desc) {
    match = desc =~ /.+-[0-9]+-g[0-9A-Fa-f]{6,}$/
    result = !match
    match = null // prevent serialisation
    return result
}

[[GitTagMessagePlugin-Example]]
== Example

At https://iosphere.de/[iosphere], we use this in the process of
automatically building and distributing beta versions of our mobile
apps:

. Commit some code
. Write or generate release notes, e.g.
`+./generateChangelog.sh > /tmp/changes+`
. Create a tag, annotating it with the release notes, e.g.
`+git tag -F /tmp/changes beta/123+`
. Push the commit and tag to the remote repo

Jenkins will then, having received a git webhook notification:

. Trigger a build of the relevant job, e.g. 'trails-beta-distribution'
. Check out the committed code, i.e. the revision at tag beta/123
. Export a GIT_TAG_MESSAGE variable — this will contain the release
notes
. Build the mobile app
. Use the $\{GIT_TAG_MESSAGE} value to fill out the release notes text
field in a post-build step, e.g. the
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/HockeyApp+Plugin[HockeyApp]
or
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Google+Play+Android+Publisher+Plugin[Google
Play Android Publisher plugin]
. Upload and deploy the app to the relevant service for distribution to
users
