[[CCCCPlugin-Other-Pmccabe]]
== Other - Pmccabe

Unfortunately, CCCC is an abandoned and unmaintained project.
http://parisc-linux.org/~bame/pmccabe/[Pmccabe] by contrast is a new and
maintained McCabe-style complexity evaluator and sloc counter. +
There is no Jenkins plugin at the moment but feel free to create it (I
can give you some input guidelines).
