This plugin makes it possible to send emails directly from a Job/Build
View.

 +
The Job Direct Mail Plugin makes it easy to send a custom email from a
Job or Build right away to the people involved in the project(the ones
configured in the email-ext-plugin and the last committers). Using
templates, things like project name, build number, project url, build
url, build status can be included automatically in the content of the
email.

[[JobDirectMailPlugin-Usage]]
== Usage

Just click on the icon "Send Mail" in the left bar of a Job or Build and
the sample email will pop.

The plugin can be configured from the global configuration page, where
you can add templates and a signature in order to save time when
constructing the email. A template has a name and specifies what the
conent of the email will look like.

The Job Direct Mail Plugin can be useful in situations like:

* A job has to be deleted and the last committers should be notified
* A job has many error or has none and the people responsible should be
notified or praised.

Important! The plugin uses information from the Email-ext plugin in
order to configure the SMTP server and SMTP port of the current mail
session. Generally, if email-ext-plugin is able to send emails, so can
this plugin. Generally, if email-ext-plugin is able to send emails, so
can this plugin. The default recipients are also retrieved from the
configuration of email-ext plugin. E-mail encoding is UTF-8(since 1.5).
E-mail encoding is UTF-8(since 1.5).
