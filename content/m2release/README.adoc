[[M2ReleasePlugin-UsingwithNexusStaging]]
== Using with Nexus Staging

Nexus staging will create a new Stage for each unique IP Address, deploy
users and HTTP User agent.

For a particular Jenkins slave the first two will be the same for all
builds - so you need to configure Maven to use a unique HTTP User-Agent
for the deploy.

To do this make sure your maven settings contains something like the
following where the id matches the id for the release repository in the
deployment section of your project:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
  <server>
    <id>nexus</id>
    <username>my_login</username>
    <password>my_password</password>
    <configuration>
      <httpHeaders>
        <property>
          <name>User-Agent</name>
          <value>Maven m2Release (java:${java.vm.version} ${env.BUILD_TAG }</value>
        </property>
      </httpHeaders>
    </configuration>
  </server>
----

[[M2ReleasePlugin-FAQ]]
== FAQ

If your build fails with the following:

____
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/M2+Release+Plugin#[INFO]
Executing: mvn clean verify --no-plugin-updates --batch-mode -P
null,null +
'mvn' is not recognized as an internal or external command, +
operable program or batch file.
____

Then this is a http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MRELEASE-359[maven bug]
not a Jenkins plug-in bug. +
The solution is to upgrade to version 2.0-beta-8 or later of the
maven-release-plugin in your project.

 +

Some users with CVS (cvs+ssh) have reported that a release just hangs
while accessing the ssh server
(https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-4783[JENKINS-4783]). The
solution is to use the native CVS client and append
"-Dmaven.scm.provider.cvs.implementation=cvs_native" to the release
arguments.

The use of this plugin requires that Maven can tag your code.  You may
need to use cvs/svn etc from the CI account on the server that is
performing the release so the native tools used by maven have the
required authentication information.  (this is outside of Jenkins SCM
authentication)
