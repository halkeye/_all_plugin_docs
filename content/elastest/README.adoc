[[ElasTestPlugin-Description]]
== Description

This plugin allows Jenkins to be integrated with
http://elastest.io/[ElasTest], an elastic platform to ease testing.

[[ElasTestPlugin-Features]]
== Features

With this plugin you will be able to:

* Associate a Jenkins Job with an ElasTest TJob. You can create a new
project on ElasTest or to use an existing project.
* Use a SUT managed by ElasTest (a SUT deployed by ElasTest or not)
* Send the logs of a build to ElasTest for advanced analyze (ElasTest
provides the *Log Analyzer*, a powerfool tool for finding what you want
in the vast flood of logs).
* Send logs and metrics of a SUT started in a Jenkins Job to ElasTest.
* Set ElasTest as your web browsers provider for your end to end tests.
* Request others test support services from ElasTest (ESS, EMS,...). For
more information about this, visit the official
ElasTest https://elastest.io/docs/jenkins/[documentation].

If you want to use a user's credentials to access ElasTest, it will be
necessay to fill the "Username" and "Password" fields. Is you fill one
of them and leave the other empty, communication with ElasTest will be
done without authentication.

[[ElasTestPlugin-Usage]]
== Usage

You can use the ElasTest plugin if you use Jobs based on "Freestyle
project" or "Pipeline" templates.

[[ElasTestPlugin-WithFreestyleproject]]
=== With Freestyle project

If you prefer to work with Freestyle projects, you should look at the
Job Configuration Page in the section "Build environment" and check the
option "Integrate the Job with ElasTest". With this, you will have
activated the shipping logs to ElasTest. If in addition to this, you
want to use the browser provided by ElasTest, you must check the EUS
field.

In this type of projects, the ElasTest plugin not offers all it's
functionalities.

[[ElasTestPlugin-WithPipeline]]
=== With Pipeline

If you prefer to work with Jobs based on Pipeline templates instead, you
must add the next step to your pipeline script to wrap the rest of the
pipeline.

*Pipeline script*

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
node {
    elastest() {
        stage ('Executing test') {
        ............
        echo 'Cloning repository'
        ............
        echo 'Running test'
        ............
        }
    }
}
----

Above we have shown you a basic example without using any plugin option.
Here is an example with all the plugin options and below the
descriptions of them:

*Pipeline script*

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
node {
    elastest(tss: ['EUS'], surefireReportsPattern: '**/target/surefire-reports/TEST-*.xml', project: 'jenkins_project', sut: 5, monitoring: true, sutParams: ['PARAM_NAME': 'value']) {

        stage ('Executing test') {
        ............
        echo 'Cloning repository'
        ............
        echo 'Running test'
        ............        
        }
    }
}
----

The meaning of each parameter is the following:

* *surefireReportsPattern:* will contain the path where the xml files
containing the test results are stored and which will be used by
ElasTest to display the test information. We explain this in more
detail https://elastest.io/docs/testing/unit#xmlAndtestResultsPath[here].
* *project:* is used to indicate the name of the ElasTest project where
the TJob associated with Jenkins Job will be created. This field is
optional and if it is not used, a project will be created with the same
name as the Job.
* *sut:* allows you to select a Sut created in ElasTest against which to
execute the job, indicating its id.
* *tss:* is used to indicate to ElasTest that the job needs to use the
EUS service to use a web browser.
* *monitoring:* used to send or not the Sut monitoring traces to
ElasTest.
* *sutParams:* used to send parameters to a SUT on ElasTest.
