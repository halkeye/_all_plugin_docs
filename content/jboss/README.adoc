Server] during build procedure.# +
With the plugin we can start/stop JBoss AS. It's very useful if we need
to run some integration tests against of the server. There is also
operation allows verification if artifacts are deployable.

The plugin is using JMX to communicate with JBoss AS so there is
possible to implement other features.

well.

[[JBossManagementPlugin-Knownissues]]
== Known issues

* There is a problem to add more then one step in build procedure at
once. This problem is related to
https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-5028[JENKINS-5028] and be
managed in jboss component
https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-5635[JENKINS-5635]. Current
workaround is to create one step save configuration and add another step
by edit job configuration and again. Sorry for that but couldn't find
quicker solution at this moment. (It looks like the problem not occuring
in 1.355 version of Hudson)
* There is a problem with version of log4j. The issue is related to
https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-4433[JENKINS-4433] and be
