[.conf-macro .output-inline]#This plugin allows you to capture code
coverage report from JaCoCo. Jenkins will generate the trend report of
coverage and some other statistics.#

It also includes functionality to include columns in Dashboards which
displays the latest overall coverage numbers and links to the coverage
report.

[[JaCoCoPlugin-GettingStarted]]
== Getting Started

The plugin provides two things, a build-publisher to record and display
coverage data as part of builds as well as a new +
column-type for dashboard views which can display coverage data in
Dashboards.

[[JaCoCoPlugin-Recordingcoverageforbuilds]]
=== Recording coverage for builds

[[JaCoCoPlugin-Getcoveragedataaspartofyourbuild]]
==== Get coverage data as part of your build

First you need to get coverage calculated as part of your build/tests,
see the http://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/[JaCoCo documentation] +
for details. You need at least one or more *.exec file available after
tests are executed. Usually this means adjusting +
your Maven pom.xml or Ant build.xml file..

[[JaCoCoPlugin-Setupcoverageretrievalandpublishing]]
==== Set up coverage retrieval and publishing

In order to get the coverage data published to Jenkins, you need to add
a JaCoCo publisher and configure it so it will +
find all the necessary information. Use the help provided via the
question-mark links for more information. Basically +
you specify where the *.exec files are, where compiled code can be found
and where the corresponding source code is +
located after the build is finished to let the plugin gather all
necessary pieces of information..

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/screenshot_039.png[image]#

[[JaCoCoPlugin-Runthejob]]
==== Run the job

After the job executed, the build-output will show that the
JaCoCo-publisher is executed and collects the data. This +
output can also give hints if something goes wrong at this stage:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]

[[JaCoCoPlugin-Lookatresults]]
==== Look at results

If data gathering is successful, the build will include a link to the
coverage results similar to the HTML report of +
JaCoCo itself. The job page will be enhanced with a chart with the trend
of code coverage over the last builds.

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/screenshot_041.png[image]#

[[JaCoCoPlugin-Coveragecolumn]]
=== Coverage column

This part of the JaCoCo plugin allows you to add a new type of column to
a project-table in the Dashboard view which +
will show the coverage number of the last build for ajob together with
some color coding which allows to quickly see +
projects with low coverage.

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/screenshot_042.png[image]#

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/screenshot_043.png[image]#

The fill-color in use by the column is a continuous color-range with the
following points:

* PERFECT = 100.0
* EXCELLENT at 97.0
* GOOD at 92.0
* SUFFICIENT at 85.0
* FAIR at 75.0
* POOR at 50.0
* TRAGIC at 25.0
* ABYSSMAL at 0.0
* NA = No coverage configured

[[JaCoCoPlugin-Troubleshooting]]
== Troubleshooting

* Unfortunately JaCoCo 0.7.5 breaks compatibility to previous binary
formats of the jacoco.exec files. The JaCoCo plugin up to version 1.0.19
is based on JaCoCo 0.7.4, thus you cannot use this version with projects
which already use JaCoCo 0.7.5 or newer. JaCoCo plugin starting with
version 2.0.0 uses JaCoCo 0.7.5 and thus requires also this version to
be used in your projects. Please stick to JaCoCo plugin 1.0.19 or lower
if you still use JaCoCo 0.7.4 or lower
