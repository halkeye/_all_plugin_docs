This plugin allows to trigger a build with a DOS script.

[[DOSTrigger-Description]]
== Description

The script will run according to the schedule you enter. +
When the script sets the *_cause_* variable to something other than the
empty string a build will be started (with the given 'cause').

*Caution*: This plugin always uses the default workspace, even if a
custom workspace was defined.
