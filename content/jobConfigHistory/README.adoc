Saves copies of all job and system
configurations.[.conf-macro .output-inline]# #

[.aui-icon .aui-icon-small .aui-iconfont-info .confluence-information-macro-icon]##

Older versions of this plugin may not be safe to use. Please review the
following warnings before using an older version:

* https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2018-09-25/#SECURITY-1130[Reflected
Cross Site Scripting vulnerability]

This plugin saves *a copy of the configuration file* of jobs and agents
(`+config.xml+`) for every change made and of the system configuration
(`+<config-name>.xml+`). +
You can also see what changes have been made by which user if you
configured a security policy.

It is also possible to get a *side-by-side view* of the differences
between two configurations and to restore an old version of a job's
configuration. (The latter is only available for jobs, not for system
changes.) +
However, if you restore an older version of the config file and the new
version contains fields that were not present in the older version, the
restored version will still contain these fields, although they were not
present in the original.

The plugin also provides an *overview page* of all changes. You can find
it under `+<jenkins_url>/jobConfigHistory+` or reach it via links in the
sidepanel of the main and the system configuration pages. +
The overview page initially only lists system configuration changes (for
performance reasons), but there are links to view either all job
configuration histories or just the deleted jobs or all kinds of
configuration history entries together (which may take some time to
load, depending on the number of jobs in your instance).

[[JobConfigHistoryPlugin-InterdependencieswithotherPlugins/Excludingconfigpathparts(jobs,folders,...)]]
== Interdependencies with other Plugins/ Excluding config path parts (jobs, folders, ...)

If you use other plugins, that are (automatically) changing the
configuration, you might end up with a lot of unwanted change
detections.

It's recommended to use the given ability, to exclude such changes by
patterns. This can be done in the System Configuration or via
<jenkins-link>/configure. Just add the corresponding pattern (e.g.
cluster-stats) in the Input *Configuration exclude file pattern*:

 +

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .image-center-wrapper]#image:docs/images/image2019-9-6_14-38-42.png[image]#

This functionality also allows you to exclude jobs, folders or other
parts of your job hierarchy: +
The pattern is attempted to be found in a config file's file path.
Adding "|__test__" to the pattern will also cause "testFolder/jobs/job1"
to be excluded. +
So if you want to exclude jobs, only, it might be better to enter
something like "|__testJob/config\.xml".__

 +

[.aui-icon .aui-icon-small .aui-iconfont-warning .confluence-information-macro-icon]#
#

If you use this plugin together with the
https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Global+Build+Stats+Plugin[Global
Build Stats Plugin] you should add `+global-build-stats+` to the
excludes in the *Configuration exclude file pattern* section of this
plugin in *Configure System* page. Fixed in version 1.9 of the plugin.

[.aui-icon .aui-icon-small .aui-iconfont-warning .confluence-information-macro-icon]#
#

If you use this plugin together with the
https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Cluster+Statistics+Plugin[Cluster
Statistics Plugin] you should add `+cluster-stats+` to the excludes in
the *Configuration exclude file pattern* section of this plugin in
*Configure System* page. Otherwise it might exceed your storage.

Warning

[.aui-icon .aui-icon-small .aui-iconfont-error .confluence-information-macro-icon]#
#

With this version the plugin changes the location where the
configuration history data is stored. This means that some data might
not be found by the plugin any longer and has to be moved manually. See
above for more information.

[.aui-icon .aui-icon-small .aui-iconfont-warning .confluence-information-macro-icon]#
#

With the 1.x versions of this plugin, the job configuration history data
used to be stored with each job
(_JENKINS_HOME/jobs/JOBNAME/config-history_), whereas the system
configuration history was stored in an extra directory under
_JENKINS_HOME_. As of version 2.0, both types of configuration history
data are now to be found in one directory under _JENKINS_HOME_. The
default location for this folder is _JENKINS_HOME/config-history_. +
Now there are two possible scenarios: +
If you did not use the default root history directory of the 1.x
version, but set it to an individual path on the Jenkins configuration
page, the 2.x versions of the plugin should still be able to find and
display the data correctly. +
However, if you did not change the path and used the default root
history directory, your job configuration data is stored with each job,
where the 2.x versions of the plugin will not find it any longer. If you
want the plugin to list the job configuration history again, you have to
move the data manually from _JENKINS_HOME/jobs/JOBNAME/config-history_
to _JENKINS_HOME/config-history/jobs/JOBNAME_. +
This can be done with a script like the following:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
#!/bin/bash -e

src=/var/lib/jenkins/jobs
target=/var/lib/jenkins/config-history/jobs

cd "$src"
# Make sure we support jobs containing space in names
dirs=( * )
for f in "${dirs[@]}"
do
        mv "$f/config-history" "$target/$f" || true
done

(per item).  Leave blank or zero to keep all entries (no maximum).

last saved entry for that item.
**  Allow saving of 'system' configurations - defined as those stored
directly in HUDSON_ROOT.

Useful because some system configurations are not interesting to save. A
recommended default value is provided.
**  Enhanced UI for selecting versions to compare.
**  Allow system configuration diffs to be viewed via the UI.
