This plugin lets you use builders, publishers and SCM settings from
another project.

[[TemplateProjectPlugin-Ashortsetupguide]]
== A short set up guide

* Set up a template project that has all the settings you want to share.
E.g. you could create one with no SCM filled in, but with all the
builders and publishers you want for all your projects. Its best to mark
this project as disabled, since you are not actually going to run it.
* Then set up a concrete project. Configure the SCM as you want. Then
select 'use all the publishers from this project' and pick the template
project. Ditto for the builders.

[[TemplateProjectPlugin-Limitations]]
== Limitations

* It may be using some plugins in ways that were not intended.
Compatibility with all plugins is not guaranteed.
* It does not support project actions. That means that links that should
be on the project page (e.g. 'latest test results') will not be there.
* It has had virtually no testing.
* "Use SCM from another project" may be missing unless you install the
https://plugins.jenkins.io/multiple-scms[multiple-scms] plugin. See
https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-31712[JENKINS-31712].

[[TemplateProjectPlugin-Todolist]]
== To do list

* Support project actions. This depends on being able to make some
changes in jenkins-core in a backward compatible way.
* Parametrize the templates.
* (Maybe) Create a separate list of template projects, so you don't have
to put them in your main list and can clearly identify them.
