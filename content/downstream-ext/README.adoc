This plugin supports extended configuration for triggering downstream
builds:

* trigger build only if downstream job has SCM changes
* trigger build if upstream build result is better/equal/worse than any
given result (SUCCESS, UNSTABLE, FAILURE, ABORTED)
* for Matrix (alias multi-configuration) jobs you can decide which part
of the job should trigger the downstream job: parent only,
configurations only or both
