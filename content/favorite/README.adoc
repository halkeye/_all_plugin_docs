This plugin allows you to mark a job a favorite.This is controlled via a
list view column you need to add to a view. You can then click on a star
to favorite or unfavorite a job. There is also a job filter to allow you
to create a view that only shows your favorites.

[[FavoritePlugin-Configuration]]
== Configuration

It is recommended you change your default view to either one you create,
or follow the directions in
https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Editing+or+Replacing+the+All+View[Editing
or Replacing the All View] to allow the Favorite column to show up. Once
you have the Favorite column, it will show a star that logged in users
will be able to click to make a favorite. You can also add another view,
and apply the "Favorites Filter" to show favorites only in that view.
