[[TestsSelectorPlugin-AboutThePropertiesFile]]
=== About The Properties File

This file will contain all your tests and (maybe) some extra fields for
the plugin.

Your properties file *MUST* have a property called tests. +
The *tests* property value is a JSON array that contains a JSON object
for each test.  +
In each test object you need to specify it's attributes by a key/value
pairs. +
The following properties will allow you to select specific fields which
have a special meaning:

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",]
|===
|*enableField* |The name of the field that will imply if the test is
enabled or not. +
If the value in the specified field, for some test(s), will be false
then the test will not be shown at all. +

|*groupBy* + |The field that the plugin will group the tests by. +
If 2 tests have the same value in this field, they will be in the same
group. +

|*showFields* + |The field(s) that will be shown in the tests tree. +

|*multiplicityField*  + |The field that will be set to the amount of
times the test should run. +

|*fieldSeparator* + |The character that will separate between the fields
in the tests tree. +
|===

All fields are case-sensitive. +
*Each property must* be defined either in the properties file *OR* in
the override section.  +
If you want to change the properties you defined in the file, you can
override them in the override section.

This is an *example* for a properties file which contains all above
properties:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
tests=[{"enabled":true,"owner":"shushu","testgroup":"A","testcase":"single"},{"enabled":false,"owner":"shushu","testgroup":"B","setuptype":"basic"}]
enableField=enabled
groupBy=testgroup
fieldSeparator=.
showFields=testsuite,testcase
multiplicityField=multiplicity
