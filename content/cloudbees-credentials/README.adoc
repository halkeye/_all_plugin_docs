This plugin extends
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Credentials+Plugin[Credentials
Plugin] and allow Jenkins to store your
http://www.cloudbees.com/[CloudBees] account information and its
password. This is normally not a plugin that you'll choose to install on
its own. Rather, it gets installed as a dependency of other plugins.

If you are writing a plugin that interacts with CloudBees service and
wants to share the same credentials with other plugins. Consider
depending on
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/CloudBees+Registration+Plugin[CloudBees
Registration plugin] that provides UI and concrete implementation. This
plugin just defines contracts of the CB credentials.
