[[GatlingPlugin-Configuration]]
== Configuration

. Install Gatling Plugin (via Manage Jenkins -> Manage Plugins)
. Configure your project to execute Gatling simulations, for example
using the Maven plugin (see
https://github.com/gatling/gatling-maven-plugin-demo[Maven plugin demo])
. Configure your job :
.. For a maven job: add "Track a Gatling load simulation" as a new
post-build action. Beware that neither your Jenkin's path nor your job's
name should contain any space.
.. For a pipeline job: add a line to your pipeline script:
_gatlingArchive()_

*Optional configuration*: You can publish Gatling results with the
Jenkins JUnit plugin. Your Gatling simulation needs to have some
assertions, as each Junit testcase is a different Gatling assertion.

. Configure the Jenkins plugin with the following Test report XMLs:
_target/gatling/assertions-*.xml_
. Execute Gatling with the following option:
_-Dgatling.useOldJenkinsJUnitSupport=true_, for example: _mvn
gatling:execute -Dgatling.useOldJenkinsJUnitSupport=true_

Gatling Plugin will look for files under your Job Root Directory
(defaults to _`+$JENKINS_HOME/yourjobname)+`_, so you may need to copy
the results file if you're doing a containerized job.

[[GatlingPlugin-Gatlingpluginusage]]
== Gatling plugin usage

As soon as you've properly configured your job and launched a build,
you'll see two changes on your project dashboard :

* A new entry will be available in the left summary : Gatling.
* A graph, displaying the mean response time trend of your last 15
builds, will appear.

 

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .image-center-wrapper]#image:docs/images/dashboard.png[image]#

 

The Gatling entry in the left summary has two purposes, depending on
which page you are.

If you are on the project dashboard, clicking on Gatling will get you to
a more detailed performance trend, displaying for your last 30 builds :

* Mean response time trend
* 95th percentiles response time trend
* Percentage of KO requests

This page will also provides links to detailed reports for all your
builds, at the bottom of the page.

If you are on the summary of a specific build, clicking on Gatling will
get you to a list of all available reports for this build.
