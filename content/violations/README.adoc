[[Violations-Description]]
== Description

The violations plug-in scans for violation xml files of particular types
in the build workspace, gathers the violations and reports on the
numbers for each type. The currently supported types are:

[width="100%",cols="20%,20%,20%,20%,20%",options="header",]
|===
|type |url |version |maintainer |notes
|checkstyle |http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/ |4.2 |  | 

|pmd |http://pmd.sourceforge.net/[http://pmd.sourceforge.net] |4.0 |  | 

|cpd |http://pmd.sourceforge.net/cpd.html |4.0 |  | 

|findbugs |http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/ |1.3.3rc2 |  |There are some
issues with the maven plugin of findbugs - one needs to set the
sourcepath field and it also appears that some violations are reported
against incorrect files.

[[Violations-Configuration]]
== Configuration

*Note: the following snapshots are from version 0.4, version 0.7 is
similar (with pylint, fxcop, stylecop, simian and gendarme added).*

Configuration should be easy, First you need to have activate the static
code analysizers in your build. Then activate the Violations plugin as
shown below.  +
  +
 
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/violations-config-0.3.png[image]#

The fields are:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|name |description
|Per file display limit |This is used to limit the number of violations
displayed per file per violation type.

|type |The violation type.

|sun icon |This is the lowest number of violations of this type to
generate the sunny weather report. For example the value 10 means that
violations 0 to 10 will cause a sunny report, 11 and higher will be
cloudy or worse.

|stormy icon |The is the lowest number of violations of this type to
generate the stormy weather report.

|XML filename pattern |This is an ant type pattern to match violation
files of this type in the workspace. Multiple patterns may be separated
by commas.

|Source Path Pattern |This is an optional field. It is used to resolve
classnames to source file names. It is only currently used by the
findbugs violations type.

|Faux Project Path |This is an optional field. It is used if you just
want to run jenkins as a reporting engine for a project not in jenkins
workspace. For example, the violations plugin has a jenkins job that
cd's to the cvs directory, creates the checkstyle, pmd and cpd reports
and the invokes violations plugin with the faux project path set to
(PATH TO CVS DIR)/plugins/violations.
|===

After configuration, the Violations plugin will collect violations from
the next build. The following pages are created or modified.

[[Violations-ProjectPage]]
== Project Page

The project page is modified to add a violation icon (
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/dialog-warning.png[image]#)
and a violation trend graph:

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/project-list.png[image]#
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/violation-trend.png[image]#

Clicking on the violations link brings one to the current violations
report. 

[[Violations-Buildpage]]
== Build page

 +

The build page also has the violations trend and the violations icon.
Clinking on the violations link brings one to the violations report for
this particular build.

[[Violations-Violationsreportpage]]
==  Violations report page

*Note the following snapshots are from 0.4, 0.7 is similar, except that
the +/- notation has been removed.*

The start of the violations report page looks like this: +
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/violations-report-head.png[image]# +
For each violation type a trend and file summary is shown as follows:
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/violations-checkstyle-trend.png[image]# +
The order of the table can be changed by clinking on the column header.

[[Violations-PerFileReport]]
==  Per File Report

Linking on the file link brings on to the file report. This will show
all the violations (up to a limit specified in the config page) of a
file, Each violation has a line number, an icon representing the
severity and a description of the violation. Hovering over the icon will
give more detail on the violation - and for *findbugs,* this will be the
long detailed message. After the list of violations, snipets from the
source file will be shown for each violation. This will only happen if
the violations plugin can find the file in question. +
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/violations-file-1.png[image]# +
  +
. +
 Hovering over the violations icon on the highlighted line will cause a
pop-up of the violations on the line:
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/violations-popup.png[image]#
