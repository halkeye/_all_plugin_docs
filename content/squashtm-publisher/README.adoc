[[Squash4JenkinsPlugin-Summary]]
== Summary

[[Squash4JenkinsPlugin-Description]]
=== Description

This plugin publishes the test results of a Jenkins build in Squash TM
when a build completes. It works on top of other publisher plugins
dedicated to the test technology that used in the build (junit, nunit,
mstest etc), before pushing the results.

[[Squash4JenkinsPlugin-Usage]]
=== [.anchor]#Usage#

The plugin leverages the workflow implemented in the
https://sites.google.com/a/henix.fr/wiki-squash-ta/tm---ta-guide/user-guide[Squash
TM / Squash TA integration scenario]. In a few words, it allows Squash
TM to list the tests of a job, trigger a build and gather the test
results, with some restrictions (listed in section Comparison with
Squash TA). The job can be of any nature (free-style or else) and use
any test technology (if a Jenkins plugin is also configured for it).

Also, due to the nature of that workflow please note that in this
version the publisher will process the results *only if the build was
triggered by Squash TM*. This limitation will be addressed in future
developments.

[[Squash4JenkinsPlugin-Dependencies]]
=== [.anchor]#Dependencies#

This plugin works for Jenkins version 1.651.3 or higher and requires
JUnit plugin v1.19+ (not tested with earlier versions).

[[Squash4JenkinsPlugin-Jenkinsconfiguration]]
== Jenkins configuration

[[Squash4JenkinsPlugin-Globalsettings]]
=== Global settings

As an administrator, go to the system configuration (first item in the
administrator view). Scroll down to the TM Publisher section. From
there, you can add one or several TM servers by clicking on the *[Add]*
button and filling the following informations :

* server name : a label that identify a given instance of Squash TM
* server URL : the base URL of the TM server
* login : the login of the account on Squash TM that Jenkins will use to
push the results. NB : that user must belong to the 'Test Automation
Server' user group.
* password : the password of that user.

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .image-center-wrapper .confluence-embedded-manual-size]##image:docs/images/jenkins_global_settings.PNG[image,width=1109]##These
will allow the plugin to identify instances of Squash TM that request
for result update, and to authenticate on them.

The *[Validate]* button (next to *[Delete]*) will test that the server
is reachable and up. For now the credentials aren't validated yet.
Potential errors in your configuration will issue a warning. Once you
are done save the configuration as usual. You can save the configuration
even if warnings were reported, e.g. when the endpoint is down at the
moment yet the URL is correct nonetheless.

[[Squash4JenkinsPlugin-JobSettings]]
=== Job Settings

As a job manager, go to the configuration page of your job.

Jobs of all nature are supported. As a job manager, go to the
configuration page of your job. In order to work the plugin requires two
simple items. First, on the general job properties, tick the box
'_Enable integration with Squash TM_'.

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .image-center-wrapper .confluence-embedded-manual-size]#image:docs/images/jenkins_general.PNG[image,height=400]#

 +

Then add a new post-build step : 'Publish your tests results on Squash
TM'.

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .image-center-wrapper .confluence-embedded-manual-size]#image:docs/images/jenkins_publish_tm.PNG[image,width=1109]#

 +

That's all you need to configure TM-publisher per-se. However you will
also need to configure additional test result publishers such as
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/JUnit+Plugin[JUnit plugin],
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/NUnit+Plugin[NUnit plugin],
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/JSUnit+plugin[JSUnit plugin]
etc. Remember that TM-publisher simply pushes tests results, it does not
generate them.

Note that 'Maven project' job style implicitly handle jUnit test results
: if you run a Maven job and your tests are run by a jUnit runner you
don't need to configure extra test results publishers.

 +

In some cases, further configuration is needed to access the reports.

#

The following example is a Junit test with Gradle :

* As a job manager, go to the configuration page of your job then to the
‘_Post-build Actions_’ tab
* Add a new post-build action: ‘_Publish Junit test result report_’
* Fill in the ‘_Test report XMLs field_’ with the path of your test
reports
* Make sure the ‘_Publish Junit test result report_’ action is
[.underline]#above# ‘_Publish your tests results on Squash TM_’.

[[Squash4JenkinsPlugin-ComparisonwithSquashTA]]
== Comparison with Squash TA

The main user stories implemented by a regular Squash TM-TA stack are
fullfiled by the TM-publisher, but not all. Because the TM-publisher
plugin makes no assumption about the actual build tools and test runners
involved in the Jenkins build, many advanced features from Squash TA are
not available here due to integration problems.

The following features are supported :

* TM user can bind a test case to a remote test hosted on Jenkins
* TM user can start automated test suites
* Test statuses are updated automatically on build completion

The following features are *NOT* supported :

* Passing datasets to the automated tests
* Running only a subset of the test suite : the job will run entirely
and all tests will be run
* Dispatch the tests on available slave nodes
* Running tests in a specified order
* Real-time status updates : all results will be pushed at the end of
the build
