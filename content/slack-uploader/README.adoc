[[SlackFileUploaderPlugin-Summary]]
== Summary

Jenkins is a wonderful continuous integration system which automates
your build process for you. Frequently artifacts and files are generated
during the build process which one may want to share with their team.
This plugin was born out of that necessity and streamlines the process
of posting such files to Slack, the popular chat messenger for companies
and teams. With bare minimum configuration, you get a slack uploader!
