This plugin overrides the default Load Balancer behavior and assigns
jobs to nodes with the least load

[[LeastLoadPlugin-Overview]]
== Overview

By default Jenkins tries to allocate a jobs to the last node is was
executed on. This can result in nodes being left idle while other nodes
are overloaded. This plugin overrides the default behavior and assigns
jobs to nodes with the least load. The least load is defined as a node
that is idle or the one with the most available executors. It is
intended to provide the same functionality as the commercial plugin

Scheduler Plugin]

[[LeastLoadPlugin-Configuration]]
== Configuration

The plugin requires no global configuration it will just replace the
default load balancer at startup. Jobs can be configured to utilize the
default Jenkins load balancer if required.
