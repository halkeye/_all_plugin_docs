Allows pipelines to configure an NPM environment via managed npmrc files

[[PipelineNPMPlugin-Summary]]
== Summary

This plugin provides integration with Pipeline by configuring an NPM
environment to use within a pipeline job by calling `+sh npm+` or
`+bat npm+`. This is accomplished by adding an `+npmrc+` as a custom
config file to be centrally managed by Jenkins. This is useful for
managing registries, authorizations, and any other npm settings that one
would like to manage via Jenkins outside of the pipeline itself.

This plugin works both with and without Docker containers as build
steps.

[[PipelineNPMPlugin-Configuration]]
== Configuration

Via Config File Management, Manage Jenkins -> Managed Files, add an
npmrc entry specifying the id that will be used in the pipeline
configuration.

[[PipelineNPMPlugin-BasicUsage]]
== Basic Usage

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
withNPM(npmrcConfig: 'my-custom-nprc') {
    sh 'npm install'
}
----

In the above example, 'my-custom-npmrc' is a config file that had been
added as a custom, Managed File. Underneath, the custom `+npmrc+` is
being copied to the workspace where it will serve as a local override
during the build. Nominally, npm would have a command line mechanism for
specifying the npmrc, but for now the best choice to force an override
is to place the `+npmrc+` in the workspace where it will be prioritized
over the home and global `+npmrc+`.

Here is another example using Docker and
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Pipeline+Model+Definition+Plugin[Pipeline
Model Definition Plugin].  When using the Docker based approach, the
npmrc is installed to the user home location.

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
stage('npm-build') {
    agent {
        docker {
            image 'node:7.4'
        }
    }

    steps {
        echo "Branch is ${env.BRANCH_NAME}..."

        withNPM(npmrcConfig:'my-custom-npmrc') {
            echo "Performing npm build..."
            sh 'npm install'
        }
    }
}

[[PipelineNPMPlugin-KnownIssues]]
=== Known Issues

* When not using a Docker based build, NPM must be installed on the
build executor.
* When not using a Docker based build, any local npmrc to the workspace
will be replaced by this plugin.

[[PipelineNPMPlugin-Changelog]]
=== Changelog

* 0.9.0 -- Initial Release
* 0.9.1 -- Removed wrapper script since there is no useful way to
override the npmrc on the command line.  This simplifies things a fair
bit in terms of the code.
