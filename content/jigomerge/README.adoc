This plugin adds the ability to directly merge Subversion branches in
Jenkins. See http://code.google.com/p/jigomerge/

[[Jigomergeplugin-Configuration]]
== Configuration

Configure your Subversion repository in the *Source Code
Management* section : this is the branch you want to merge to.

In the *Build Triggers* section, set a value in *Build periodically*. Do
not use *Poll SCM* !  

_Advice_ : The merge to be effective should be run as often as possible.
For exemple set the Build periodically to _every hour_. This will
prevent conflicts as much as possible.

In the *Build* section, choose *Perform svn merge with Jigomerge*.

3 fields are mandatory :

* source : the repository you want to merge from
* username : the username to merge with
* password

Optional fields :

* one by one : if checked, one commit per revision merge
* eager : if checked, try to merge revisions even if a previous one is
conflicting. Use with caution !
