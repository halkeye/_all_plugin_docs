This plugin builds on top of
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Deployment+Notification+Plugin[Deployment
Notification Plugin] and lets Chef users track when/where/what files are
deployed, and trigger other activities after deployments have happened.

The plugin works by having `+chef-solo+` or `+chef-client+` submit
information about what it has deployed. We do this by running
https://github.com/jenkinsci/chef-handler-jenkins[chef-handler-jenkins]
inside chef, which monitors Chef's activities and find out which files
have been updated.

That custom handler submits this information to Jenkins in the end, and
this Jenkins plugin takes it from there and adds appropriate information
to the Jenkins fingerprints.
