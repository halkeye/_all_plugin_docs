[[DeployedonColumnPlugin-DeployedonColumnPlugin]]
== Deployed on Column Plugin

This plugin provides a column that acts as a container for build actions
that record deployment of build artifacts to remote servers, such as
deployment of web applications to servers, etc. The plugin also provides
an extension point for other plugins to contribute their build actions.

[[DeployedonColumnPlugin-Screenshots]]
=== Screenshots

A basic screenshot showing one build (the last blue ball) which had been
deployed to an App Engine hosting service provided by some search engine
company or other. Clicking on the icon will, in this case, bring you to
the deployed application. But implementations of the extension point are
free to decide the exact behaviour. +
