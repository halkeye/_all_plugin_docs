[[KlocworkCommunityPlugin-NoteonDepreciationinv2.0+]]
== Note on Depreciation in v2.0+

Please note that in v2.0 we added new functionality to the plugin.
Instead of updating (and possibly breaking) the old parts of the plugin
we added completely new functionality. We will not remove any existing
functionality but have marked it as Deprecated and will not actively add
new features to it. Instead we recommend that you start using the new
features, as detailed in the
http://emenda.com/jenkins-klocwork-docs[documentation]. We hope that the
new features are better and easier for you to use!

[[KlocworkCommunityPlugin-Changelog]]
== Changelog

[[KlocworkCommunityPlugin-Version2.5.2]]
=== Version 2.5.2

* General Update: switched pom.xml to use jenkins https. This change
does not impact existing configuration or behaviour. 

[[KlocworkCommunityPlugin-Version2.5.1]]
=== Version 2.5.1

* Bug Fix: Resolved issue where the diff analysis command line is too
long.  The diff file is now passed as an argument file, rather than each
file on the command line. Also skipped the check internally between the
diff file and the build specification as kwciagent does this itself and
also provides output to skipped files. This change does not impact
existing configuration or behaviour. 

[[KlocworkCommunityPlugin-Version2.5.0]]
=== Version 2.5.0

* Feature: Added option to the advanced section of the integration
analysis step, that if the specified project does not exist it will be
created or duplicated from another. This change does not impact existing
configuration or behaviour (off by default), however to make use of the
new feature extra pipeline configuration or GUI configuration is
needed. 

[[KlocworkCommunityPlugin-Version2.4.9]]
=== Version 2.4.9
