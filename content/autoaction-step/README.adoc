_Run the auto actions from "flat lines" scripts based on Selenium
WebDriver_

This plugin is used to simplify the usage of Selenium WebDriver which is
main tool for Automate testing and other tasks.

For example, to complete below form:

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .confluence-embedded-manual-size]#image:docs/images/image2019-6-26_21-36-8.png[image,width=826,height=578]#

We just need few lines as below:

*Script content*

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
Open https://accounts.google.com/SignUp?lp=1&hl=en
Input Auto First Name
Input Action Last Name
Input autoaction2019 Username
Input autoaction123 Password
Input autoaction123 Confirm
Click Next
----

instead of complex coding by Java, or Python ...
