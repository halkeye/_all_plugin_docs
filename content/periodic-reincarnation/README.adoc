This plugin makes it possible to periodically restart failed jobs
according to a number of conditions. Its main purpose is to fix
infrastructure failures.

[[PeriodicReincarnationPlugin-CronRestart]]
== Cron Restart

Using a cron time format the user can specify at which exact time(s) the
plugin should schedule failed jobs for a new build. In addition to that
he/she can also specify a list of regular expressions in order to
restrict which failed jobs exactly should be picked up for restart.
There is a global cron tab and also every regular expression has its own
such that can be individually configured. The global one is used when
the cron tab for a certain regular expression is empty or cannot be
compiled.

[[PeriodicReincarnationPlugin-UnchangedRestart]]
== Unchanged Restart

There is also the option to restart a job (independently from the
regular expressions) if the following conditions hold:

. The last build has failed.
. The second last was a success.
. There were no SCM or configuration changes between these two builds.

Basically if these conditions hold it means that it is very possible
that the code or the configuration of the job are not responsible for
the failure of the last build. This leaves a infrastructure problem and
PeriodicReincarnation will automatically try to build the project again.

In order to check if there was a configuration change
PeriodicReincarnation uses
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/JobConfigHistory+Plugin[jobConfigHistory]
plugin. It is an optional dependency so the plugin will continue to work
if jobConfigHistory is not installed, but won't be able to tell if there
was a configuration change and will always assume there wasn't one.

[[PeriodicReincarnationPlugin-AfterbuildRestart]]
== Afterbuild Restart

This feature was introduced in 1.2 and allows the immediate restart
after a build failure occurs. It can be enabled globally for all
projects or configured locally for every project alone. In order to
prevent endless restarting there is a maximal restart depth that can
also be set locally or globally. For projects where "Configure
PeriodicReincarnation locally" has not been enabled restart happens like
in the cron restart option - there must be a regex hit or an unchanged
project that fails for the first time. For projects which have this
option enabled (it can be found in the configuration page of every
project, should be in the top) the restart will happen also if there is
no regular expression that covers this project.

[[PeriodicReincarnationPlugin-Usage]]
== Usage

This plugin can be useful when something temporary may be causing a
build to fail. its main purpose is to fix infrastructure problems
preventing jobs to build successfully. For instance

* there was not enough space on the hard disk - (here a disk-cleanup
script can be automatically executed before the job is scheduled for
restart)
* there was a communication problem with a slave - (here a script that
disconnects such agent can be executed before the job is scheduled for
restart)
* there was some incompatibility of some kind

It is easy to periodically restart all jobs that have failed because of
some arbitrary "error_failing_the_build". Just activate the plugin, set
the cron time ("* * * * *" for every minute or "*/5 * * * *" for every 5
minutes) and add this "error_failing_the_build" as regular expression.

If you want jobs failing because of this "error_failing_the_build" to be
scheduled for restart right away then use the afterbuild restart option.
Just enabled it and leave the regular expression in the list.

If you want different regular expressions to be triggered at different
times, just configure the cron time in the regular expression itself. It
is very easy, just go to the global configuration page.

[[PeriodicReincarnationPlugin-Configuration]]
== Configuration

The configuration for this plugin can be found in the global
configuration page of Jenkins under "Periodic Reincarnation of failed
builds". Each option there has a help page, so it is easier to
understand and use every feature presented in the configuration of this
plugin.

For individual jobs: the local configuration reveals after clicking the
box "Configure PeriodicReincarnation locally" and contains just the
parameters for the afterbuild restart - whether it is enabled or not and
the maximal restart depth.

[[PeriodicReincarnationPlugin-Scriptsexecution]]
== Scripts execution

This feature was introduced in 1.2 and allows binding regular
expressions with groovy scripts. Each time a reg ex hit occurs and a
failed job is about to be restarted because of it these Groovy scripts
will be executed before the restart. This can be very useful in
correcting infrastructure errors like full disk or slave problems.
