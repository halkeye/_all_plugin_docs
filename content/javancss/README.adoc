[[JavaNCSSPlugin-ConfiguringtheJavaNCSSPlugin]]
== Configuring the JavaNCSS Plugin

For a freestyle project, check the Java NCSS checkbox in the Post-build
Actions section. Set the XML report pattern according to the
instructions there. Optionally add health report thresholds (see below
for details).

For a Maven type project, report data will be collected automatically
when the `+javancss:report+` goal is used. Optionally check the Java
NCSS checkbox in the Build Settings section to add health report
thresholds (see below for details).

For health report thresholds, enter "healthy" and "unhealthy" thresholds
for the selected metric. Build health will be 100% if the metric is
better than the healthy threshold, and 0% (failed build) if worse than
the unhealthy threshold. Health percentage is calculated on a linear
scale when the metric falls between the two thresholds. +
For the "% of lines that are comments" metric, use threshold values from
0 to 100. +
For the "ratio of javadocs to classes and functions" metric, use
threshold values from 0.0 to 1.0.
