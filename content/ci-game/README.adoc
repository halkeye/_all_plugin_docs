This plugin introduces a game where users gets point on improving the
builds.The plugin is a simple proof of concept of the Build game that
was created by
http://clintshank.javadevelopersjournal.com/ci_build_game.htm[Clint
Shank]. The idea behind the game is to decrease the number of times a
build becomes broken. To win the game the developers have to commit code
that is compiling and keep adding unit tests.

[[TheContinuousIntegrationGameplugin-Usage]]
== Usage

[[TheContinuousIntegrationGameplugin-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Version requirements

[.aui-icon .aui-icon-small .aui-iconfont-warning .confluence-information-macro-icon]#
#

Note that the plugin version 1.13+ requires Hudson 1.320 to work and the
following plugin versions:

* Checkstyle 3.1
* Findbugs 4.0
* PMD 3.1
* Tasks 4.0
* Warnings 3.0
* Violations 0.5.4
* analysis-core 1.0

The plugin is not activated for all jobs at start, each separate job has
to activate the game. The game can also be de-activated in one job if
some large merge activity is going to take place. To activate the game
for a job, go to the job configuration page, click "Add post-build
action" and select "_Continuous integration game_" from the list of
available post-build actions.

[[TheContinuousIntegrationGameplugin-Buildscorecard]]
=== Build score card

For each build the game calculates, according to the rules, the number
of points that it is worth. Each user that is responsible for the build
(ie comitters) receives the points. +

=== Leader board

To see who is winning the build game, there is a leader board that is
shown on the front page. +

[[TheContinuousIntegrationGameplugin-Rules]]
== Rules

The rules of the game are:

* -10 points for breaking a build
* 0 points for breaking a build that already was broken
* +1 points for doing a build with no failures (unstable builds gives no
points)
* -1 points for each new test failures
* +1 points for each new test that passes

Rules that depend on other plugins:

* https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/PMD+Plugin[PMD Plugin].
Adding/removing a HIGH priority warning = -5/+5. Adding/removing a
MEDIUM priority warning = -3/+3. Adding/removing a LOW priority warning
= -1/+1.
* https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Task+Scanner+Plugin[Task
Scanner Plugin]. Adding/removing a HIGH priority task = -5/+5.
Adding/removing a MEDIUM priority task = -3/+3. Adding/removing a LOW
priority task = -1/+1

[[TheContinuousIntegrationGameplugin-Addingrulestothegame]]
=== Adding rules to the game

Currently there are three ways to add rules to the game.

[[TheContinuousIntegrationGameplugin-Patch]]
==== Patch

Send me a patch for the rule implementation, and I can include it in the
main game plugin.

[[TheContinuousIntegrationGameplugin-Includingrulesinanotherplugin]]
==== Including rules in another plugin

You are a maintainer of a plugin and would like to add rules to the game
with data from your plugin. To do this you should declare the game
plugin as an
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Dependencies+among+plugins#Dependenciesamongplugins-Optionaldependencies[optional
dependency] to your plugin. To create rules implement the interface
*Rule*, and group them together in a *RuleSet*. To add a *RuleSet* to
the game, add it to the game's *RuleBook*.

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
hudson.plugins.cigame.PluginImpl.GAME_PUBLISHER_DESCRIPTOR.getRuleBook().addRuleSet(pluginruleset);
----

If there are already rules for your plugin in the game plugin, let me
know so they can be removed from the plugin.

[[TheContinuousIntegrationGameplugin-Includerulesinathirdplugin]]
==== Include rules in a third plugin

You would like to add rules to the game that are only valid for your
organization and do not want to share them. To do this you should
declare the game plugin as a
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Dependencies+among+plugins#Dependenciesamongplugins-Mandatorydependencies[mandatory
dependency] to your plugin. Then implement the *Rule* and add them to
the *RuleBook* as in above point.
