[[MySTPlugin-AboutMyST]]
== About MyST

Rubicon Red MyST provides an automated process for the installation,
configuration, patching and deployment of Oracle Fusion Middleware and
Applications.

The automated installation is driven by simple models (or metadata),
which defines the environment specific properties, which are captured
during the initial platform design.

MyST provides a number of key capabilities, including:

* Ability to define Fusion Middleware environment templates, from which
we can provision new environments on demand.
* Easily automates the build and deployment of FMW solutions, and
configurations into development, test, and production environments. 

Oracle products supported by MyST, include:

* Oracle Weblogic Server
* Oracle SOA Suite
* Oracle Service Bus (OSB)
* Oracle Business Process Manager (BPM)
* Oracle Business Activity Monitoring (BAM)
* Oracle Identity and Access Management 
* Oracle Unified Directory (OUD)
* Oracle Policy Automation (OPA)
* Oracle OAM Webgate
* Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM)
* Oracle HTTP Server (OHS)
* Oracle AIA Foundation Pack
* Oracle AIA Process Integration Pack
* Oracle Data Integrator (ODI)
* Oracle WebCenter Portal and Content

[[MySTPlugin-SystemConfiguration]]
=== System Configuration

*a) Configuring the MyST Agent*

* Copy the MyST Agent ZIP file under the following directory in
Jenkins: <JENKINS_HOME>/userContent/myst (make sure the file has the
correct file permission)
* In the Jenkins web console, select: "Jenkins" > "Manage Jenkins" >
"Configuration"

 
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/mystAgent1.png[image]#

* Click on the "Add MyST Agent" button
* Configure the MyST agent: 
** Name this MyST agent installation as the MyST version number. In this
example, the version is 2.4.4.0. 
** Select the "Install automatically" checkbox and Select "Add
Installer", as follows. Leave the MYST_HOME field empty. 
** Set the Download URL for binary archive, which will point to the MyST
ZIP file copied previously. You must configure the following URL:
http://<JENKINS_MASTER_HOST:PORT>/userContent/myst/<MYST_AGENT_ZIP_FILE>.
e.g: http://ci-server:8084/userContent/myst/myst-impl-2.4.4.0.zip

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/a.png[image]#

   

* Click on the "Save" button

*b) Configuring MyST*

* In the Jenkins web console, select: "Jenkins" > "Manage Jenkins" >
"Configuration"
* Enable the "MyST Console Integration" checkbox, in order to integrate
Jenkins jobs with the MyST Web console

 
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/mystconsole-integration.png[image]#

* Enter the "MyST Console URL". http://<HOST>:8082/myst-web
* Click on the "Save" button

[[MySTPlugin-JobConfiguration]]
=== Job Configuration

*a) Creating a new MyST Job*

* On the Jenkins web console, click on the "New Item" link on the left
hand side
* For the purpose of this documentation, we are creating a Job called
"CI-Provision", which will be responsible for provisioning (install,
create a domain and configure) an Oracle Fusion Middleware SOA
environment. Select the option "Build a free-style software project",
and click on the "OK" button.

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/myst-newjob.png[image]#

* A new scree will be opened with the job configuration details
* It's recommended to run this job on the same machine where the
Weblogic Admin Server will be running. To do this, you will have to
pre-configure the Jenkins Nodes (slaves), which is not covered by this
documentation. In the job configuration, you will have to select the
checkbox "Restrict where this job can be run", and type the name of the
node label, as follows. In this case, we defined a label called
"ci-soa-vm".

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/myst-restrictwherejobcanberun.png[image]#

* Select the source control provider and the location where your MyST
workspace is located in source control. In the following example, we are
checking out the MyST workspace from SVN. Note that you must checkout
the MyST workspace, which has an immediate directory child called "conf"

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/myst-checkout.png[image]# +

* Under the "Build" section, select the "Invoke MyST" option, as
follows:

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/myst-build-invokeMyST.png[image]#

* At this point, Jenkins will communicate with the MyST Web Console, and
will retrieve the available configurations and available MyST actions.
We will select the *provision* action against the environment called
"env.ci.soa.platform (CI SOA Environment)", as follows:

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/myst-invokeMySTConfigured.png[image]#

* Click on the "Save" button at the bottom of the page in the Jenkins
Web console.

[[MySTPlugin-Provisioninganenvironment]]
== Provisioning an environment

* Select the Jenkins job called "CI-Provision"
* You will notice that the Jenkins job has the MyST logo and a "MyST
Dashboard" link, as follows:

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/myst-job.png[image]#

* If you click on the MyST Dashboard link, you will be redirected to the
MyST Web Console Environment Definition, which has the detailed
environment topology, as follows: 
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/Screen_Shot_2014-06-20_at_1.45.50_pm.png[image]#

* Going back to Jenkins web console, under the "CI-Provision" Jenkins
job, click on the "Build Now" icon, in order to Provision the CI
environment.
