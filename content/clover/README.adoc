{empty}[.conf-macro .output-inline]##This plugin allows you to capture
code coverage reports from http://openclover.org/[OpenClover] - a free
and open source tool based on source code of
https://atlassian.com/software/clover/[Atlassian Clover]. Jenkins will
generate and track code coverage across time. This plugin can be used
without the need to modify your
build.xml.##http://twitter.com/cloverallover[[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/twitter3.png[image]#]

[[CloverPlugin-Installation]]
== Installation

. Install Jenkins Clover Plugin.
. Install
http://openclover.org/doc/manual/latest/ant--adding-to-ants-classpath.html[clover.jar
in Ant's classpath] (since Jenkins Clover Plugin 4.10.0).

[[CloverPlugin-AutomaticintegrationforAntbuilds]]
== Automatic integration for Ant builds

Clover can be integrated into Ant-based builds without the need to
modify the build.xml
image:docs/images/star_yellow.svg[(star)]
. Simply check the _"Automatically record and report Code Coverage"_
checkbox in the Job configuration screen.

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/clover-one-click.png[image]#

The Clover plugin will add an Ant build listener and appropriate
configuration parameters to allow Clover HTML, XML, JSON and Historical
reports to be generated for your Job.

These will automatically be linked to from the Job and Build pages.

 +

image:docs/images/star_yellow.svg[(star)]
It works for typical build configurations in which unit tests are
launched after compilation. In case you spawn processes, run
in-container tests, deploy application to another machine etc then the
automatic integration will not be sufficient and you'll have to set up
integration manually.

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .image-center-wrapper]#image:docs/images/clover-treemap.png[image]#

[[CloverPlugin-Viewingthereport]]
== Viewing the report

As soon as build is finished, click on the "Clover HTML report" link to
display the code coverage report.

[.aui-icon .aui-icon-small .aui-iconfont-error .confluence-information-macro-icon]#
#

Jenkins 1.641 introduced content security policy, which blocks any
active content in published artficats. As a result, when you click on
the link, it will display the "Loading dashboard.html..." message
instead of the report. In order to fix it, you must relax the policy to
allow JavaScript, CSS and images.
See https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Configuring+Content+Security+Policy
for more details.

[[CloverPlugin-Cloverdocumentation]]
== Clover documentation

We recommend reading the official
http://openclover.org/documentation[OpenClover Documentation] home page
- you will find instructions how to integrate Clover with Ant, Maven,
Grails and other tools.

In case of trouble, you may have a look at the
https://community.atlassian.com/[Atlassian Community] page (questions
tagged 'clover').

[[CloverPlugin-ManuallyconfiguringtheCloverplugin]]
== Manually configuring the Clover plugin

. Install the Clover plugin
. https://wiki.jenkins.io/htt[Configure your project's build script] to
generate Clover XML reports
. *Optional:* Configure your project's build script to generate clover
HTML or PDF reports (this plugin prefers HTML reports to PDF).  The
plugin will not extract any information from these reports, but will use
them as a better formatted most recent coverage report when they are
available.
. Enable the "Publish Clover Coverage Report" publisher
. Specify the directory where the clover.xml report is generated.
. *Optional:* Configure the coverage metric targets to reflect your
goals. +

[[CloverPlugin-ConfiguringwithJenkinsWorkflow/Pipelinejobs]]
== Configuring with Jenkins Workflow/Pipeline jobs

As of version 4.6.0 (and later) of the plugin:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
node {
  git 'https://github.com/recena/maven-helloworld'
  sh "mvn clean clover:setup test clover:aggregate clover:clover"
  step([
    $class: 'CloverPublisher',
    cloverReportDir: 'target/site',
    cloverReportFileName: 'clover.xml',
    healthyTarget: [methodCoverage: 70, conditionalCoverage: 80, statementCoverage: 80], // optional, default is: method=70, conditional=80, statement=80
    unhealthyTarget: [methodCoverage: 50, conditionalCoverage: 50, statementCoverage: 50], // optional, default is none
    failingTarget: [methodCoverage: 0, conditionalCoverage: 0, statementCoverage: 0]     // optional, default is none
  ])
}
----

[[CloverPlugin-Mavenconfigurationwithfreestyleproject]]
== Maven configuration with freestyle project

The clover-maven-plugin is one of the plugins that highlights an issue
with how Maven 2 handles aggregator goals.

Jenkins cannot handle maven aggregator goals with the *maven2 project
(alpha)* project type due to how this project type calls Maven. In order
to obtain multi-module clover reports, you must therefore use the
*free-style software project* project type. In any case, the Jenkins
Clover Plugin does not currently support the *maven2 project (alpha)*
project type. In order to ensure that the correct aggregated report is
generated, it is necessary to invoke maven multiple times.

_Short answer:_

* Create the job as a "free-style software project".
* Enable the "Invoke top-level Maven targets" Build.
* Specify the following goals for Maven: (Note the use of the pipe
character | to invoke maven three times).

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
install
-Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true
|
clover:instrument
clover:aggregate
|
-N
clover:aggregate
clover:clover
----

* Enable the "Publish Clover Coverage Report" publisher.
* Depending on your Source Code Management, the clover report directory
will either be "target/site/clover" or
"_module-name_/target/site/clover"
* Don't forget to configure the pom.xml to generate the clover.xml
report

[[CloverPlugin-Maven2,CloverandMultimodulewitha<packaging>ear</packaging>childmodule]]
=== Maven2, Clover and Multimodule with a <packaging>ear</packaging> child module

The maven2 ear packaging will break if you use the clover goal at any
time during the same invocation of maven if you invoke the *package* or
later phases (as it will see artefacts without a classifier and with the
clover classifier, get confused and give up)

To work around this, you should configure your root pom to include the
<packaging>ear</packaging> targets only when you are not using clover...
how to do this:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
<project>
  <profiles>
    <profile>
      <id>running-clover</id>
      <build>
        <pluginManagement>
          <plugins>
            <plugin>
              <groupId>org.openclover</groupId>
              <artifactId>clover-maven-plugin</artifactId>
              <configuration>
                <generateHtml>true</generateHtml>
                <generateXml>true</generateXml>
              </configuration>
            </plugin>
          </plugins>
        </pluginManagement>
      </build>
    </profile>
    <profile>
      <id>not-running-clover</id>
      <modules>
        <module>my-ear-artifact</module>
        <!-- list any other ear child modules here -->
      </modules>
    </profile>
    ...
  </profiles>
  ...
</project>
----

The above... hack... is why it is recommended to invoke maven three
times.  If you don't need this hack, you could simplify down to two
invocations, i.e.

install clover:instrument | -N clover:aggregate clover:site
