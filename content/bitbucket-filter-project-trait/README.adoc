After installing the plugin, when creation jobs of type Bitbucket
Team/Project:

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .confluence-embedded-manual-size]#image:docs/images/Screen_Shot_2018-11-02_at_19.02.16.png[image,width=600]#

There will be two new "Behaviors" to be selected:

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .confluence-embedded-manual-size]#image:docs/images/Screen_Shot_2018-11-02_at_19.01.06.png[image,height=150]#

"Filter by project key" and "Filter by project name".

Both of this allow filtering using a regular expression.

They match your Bitbucket Cloud project as following:

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .confluence-embedded-manual-size]#image:docs/images/Screen_Shot_2018-11-02_at_19.06.48.png[image,height=150]#

"Filter by project key" will match "AN" and "AR" on the example above.

"Filter by project name" will match "Analytics" and "Architecture" on
the example above.

You can choose to filter by key or name.

Once you add one of the filters, you can write a regular expression to
filter by that project:

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .confluence-embedded-manual-size]#image:docs/images/Screen_Shot_2018-11-02_at_19.09.48.png[image,width=600]#

In the example filter above, repositories belonging to "Architecture
(AR)" will be scanned.

Repositories belonging to other projects will be filtered out.
