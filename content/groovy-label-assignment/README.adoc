Provides "Groovy script to restrict where this project can be run" in
job configuration pages.

[[GroovyLabelAssignmentplugin-What'sthis?]]
== What's this?

This plugin provides "Groovy script to restrict where this project can
be run" to the job configuration page:

* The value returned from the script is treated as a label expression.
** This label expression overrides "Restrict where this project can be
run", and "Slaves"/"Label-expression" axes of multi-configuration
projects.
** A non-string values is converted into a string with `+toString()+`.
** Returning null or empty string does not override existing label
expressions.
* Following variables are binded to the Groovy script:
** Parameters defined with "This build is parameterized".
** Axes defined with a multi-configuration project.
** Environment variables defined with plugins.
* A build does not start (trigger is ignored) in following cases:
** No groovy script is configured even though Groovy Label Assignment is
enabled in the job.
** The groovy script contains syntax errors.
** The groovy script throws an exception at the runtime.

[[GroovyLabelAssignmentplugin-Usecases]]
== Use cases

[[GroovyLabelAssignmentplugin-Usecase1]]
=== Use case 1

Think a following scenario:

* You have to build a project for multiple platforms: arm, win, linux
* There are following nodes:
+
[cols=",,,,",options="header",]
|===
|Node |Label |arm |win |linux
|win1 |vs2010,armcc |O |O |X
|win2 |armcc |X |O |X
|linux |gcc |X |X |O
|===

You can manage this by using multi-configuration project as followings:

* Define a User-defined axis "platform": arm, win, linux
* Define a Slaves axis "slave": armcc, vs2010, gcc
* Define "Combination Filter" as following:
+
[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
(platform == "arm" && slave=="armcc") || (platform == "win" && slave=="vs2010") || (platform == "linux" && slave=="gcc")
----

Groovy Label Assignment plugin provides following alternate solution:

* Define a User-defined axis "platform": arm, win, linux
* Define "Groovy script to restrict where this project can be run":
+
[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
def labelMap = [
    arm: "armcc",
    win: "vs2010",
    linux: "gcc",
];
return labelMap.get(binding.getVariables().get("platform"));
----

[[GroovyLabelAssignmentplugin-Usecase2]]
=== Use case 2

Consider to create a job with which developers build a source tree.

* You want developers can build both a release build and a snapshot with
that job. Developers select release or snapshot when they trigger a
build.
* Release build must be built on nodes labeled "RELEASE" for releasing.
Snapshot build must be built not on those nodes, but on other nodes.

You can create a satisfying job by using Groovy Label Assignment plugin:

* Parameterize the job.
* Define a Boolen Value parameter "release", which specifies the
triggering build is for release.
* Define "Groovy script to restrict where this project can be run":
+
[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
return (release == "true")?"RELEASE":"!RELEASE"
----

[[GroovyLabelAssignmentplugin-Limitations]]
== Limitations

* Some variables may not be properly binded:
** Some type of parameters may be not properly binded.
** Environment variables of some type of plugins may be not properly
binded.
** This is for Groovy Label Assignment plugin works when a build is
going to be created, and is not created. Parameters and plugins that
refers build information does not work properly.
* When Groovy Label Assignment plugin fails, a build is rejected
silently. Failures happen in following cases. You can refer the system
log to see why Groovy Label Assignment plugin failed.
** Groovy script is not defined.
** Groovy script contains syntax errors.
** Groovy script failed at the runtime.
*** Especially in case referring non-binded variables. It often happens
when running with multi-configuration project. In that case, you can
access the variable safely as following:
+
[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
binding.getVariables().get("variable-name");
----
** Returned value cannot be parsed as a label expression.

[[GroovyLabelAssignmentplugin-Howdoesthiswork?]]
== How does this work?

This plugin works as following:

. When a new build is triggerd,
`+GroovyLabelAssignmentQueueDecisionHandler+` is called.
. If `+GroovyLabelAssignmentProperty+` is assigned to the job, call it.
. `+EnvironmentContributingAction#buildEnvVars()+` is called for
retrieving variables to bind to the Groovy script.
* Parameters are defined here.
. Retrieve axes values configured to that job and bind to the Groovy
script.
. Run Groovy script.
. Parse returned value as a label expression.
. Assign it with `+LabelAssignmentAction+`.
