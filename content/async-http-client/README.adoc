[[AsyncHttpClientPlugin-AsyncHttpClientPlugin]]
== Async Http Client Plugin

This plugin provides a shared dependency on the ning.com
async-http-client library so that other plugins can co-operate when
using this library. +
Beside the dependency to the async library
(https://github.com/AsyncHttpClient/async-http-client), this plugin also
provides a utility class to help you get the proxyserver instance that
is correct for the current jenkins instance.

*Typical config setup*

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
  AsyncHttpClientConfig.Builder httpClientConfig =
          new AsyncHttpClientConfig.Builder().setRequestTimeoutInMs(25000)
               .setProxyServer(AHCUtils.getProxyServer());
----

For code which is running on the master and is happy to use a shared
instance that will be shut down with Jenkins, as of 1.7.8, there is a
singleton which keeps an instance configured for the current proxy
server:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
AHC.instance()
----

There is also a responsive mailing list for using the base
async-http-client library
