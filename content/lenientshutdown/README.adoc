[[Lenientshutdownplugin-Features]]
== Features

This plugin lets you put Jenkins in shutdown mode but still allow any
downstream builds of those currently running to also complete. Similar
functionality for taking nodes temporarily offline.

[[Lenientshutdownplugin-Globallenientshutdown]]
=== Global lenient shutdown

[[Lenientshutdownplugin-Activation]]
==== Activation

The global lenient shutdown mode for taking the Jenkins master offline
is activated under "Manage Jenkins":

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/lenient1.png[image]#

[[Lenientshutdownplugin-Pagedecorator]]
==== Page decorator

After activating global lenient shutdown, all pages get the following
header:

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/lenient3.png[image]#

This message can be configured in the Jenkins global settings page:

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/lenient2.png[image]#

[[Lenientshutdownplugin-Lenientofflineforslaves]]
=== Lenient offline for slaves

A single slave can be taken offline leniently (letting slave specific
downstream builds finish) by going to the node's page and pressing the
button:

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/lenient4.png[image]#
