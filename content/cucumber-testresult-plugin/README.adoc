[.conf-macro .output-inline]#This plugin allows you to show the results
of http://cukes.info/[Cucumber tests] within Jenkins.#

[[CucumberTestResultPlugin-ProjectConfiguration]]
== Project Configuration

To enable the plugin add the "Publish Cucumber test result report" post
build action for classic Jobs.

To record the results in Pipeline use the following syntax:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
cucumber 'glob'
----

where `+glob+` is a glob syntax - e.g. `+feature.json+` or
`+results/*.json+` or `+**/target/*.json+`

At the end of the build the cucumber json files will be parsed and
displayed as standard test results.

[[CucumberTestResultPlugin-FAQ]]
== FAQ

[[CucumberTestResultPlugin-Whydidyouwriteanewcucumberreporter?]]
=== Why did you write a new cucumber reporter?

There where limitations in the way that the existing support for
Cucumber was handled that was suboptimal.

There is nothing wrong with the
https://github.com/masterthought/jenkins-cucumber-jvm-reports-plugin-java[cucumber
jvm reports plugin] and they can be used in tandem - however that plugin
doesn't offer the normal jenkins testresult interfaces. Namely there is
no trend reports or test history. There is also no API that you can
integrate with.

Likewise you could output junit xml style reports from cucumber - but
this also has limitations. Namely the output is less than stellar, you
have no view of tags or the nice goodness that the previous mentioned
plugin provides.

This plugin solves both of these issues so you only need one place to
look. We also have some grand plans to integrate this with the
https://github.com/samsta/quarantine[quarantine] and
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Test+stability+plugin[test
stability] plugins.

[[CucumberTestResultPlugin-CanIstillusetheothercucumberplugin.]]
=== Can I still use the other cucumber plugin.

Yes both can work side by side - but why?
