[.conf-macro .output-inline]#This plugin integrates
http://bazaar-vcs.org/[Bazaar] version control system to Jenkins. The
plugin requires the Bazaar binary (bzr) to be installed on the target
machine.#

With this plugin, you can designate a Bazaar repository as the
"upstream" repository. Every build will then run "bzr pull" to bring the
tip of this upstream repository. In a similar manner, polling will check
if the upstream repository contains any new changes, and use that as the
triggering condition of the new build.

[[BazaarPlugin-Changelog]]
== Changelog

[[BazaarPlugin-Version1.22(Feb19,2013)]]
=== Version 1.22 (Feb 19, 2013)

* Checkboxes for "Clean Tree" and "lightweight checkout" were not
correctly showing as ticked (thanks toÂ Ryan Herbert for the patch)

[[BazaarPlugin-Version1.21(October12,2012)]]
=== Version 1.21 (October 12, 2012)

* Fix possible Null Pointer Exception when failing to get current remote
revision

[[BazaarPlugin-Version1.20(August27,2012)]]
=== Version 1.20 (August 27, 2012)

* Do a lightweight checkout instead of a heavyweight checkout
* Fix bug: lightweight checkout "update" would always fail as bzr update
didn't accept a repository argument. Switch to using bzr update followed
by bzr switch. This should massively improve performance for those not
doing a full branch.
* Remove "Clean Branch" advanced option (replaced with "Clean Tree"
option)
* Add a "Clean Tree" advanced option. This will run "bzr clean-tree
--quiet --ignored --unknown --detritus", preserving the .bzr directory
but doing the equivalent of wiping the workspace (starting with a fresh
slate). This should massively improve performance for projects that do
not have a clean build.
* Clarify that Loggerhead is the repository browser used by Launchpad,
and have a complete example of how to configure it.

[[BazaarPlugin-Version1.19(July2,2012)]]
=== Version 1.19 (July 2, 2012)

* Clarify license in source files
* run "bzr revert" after a pull, as if you have a directory that is
removed and re-added while having unknown files in said directory (e.g.
build artifacts), you would end up in a very bad place (this is a BZR
bug, so we work-around it with a "bzr revert").
* add a README file in sources, update maintainers list in pom.xml

[[BazaarPlugin-Version1.18(June28,2012)]]
=== Version 1.18 (June 28, 2012)

* UI fix for checkout option
(https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-12261[JENKINS-12261])
* Auto-recover from corrupt BZR branches (e.g. bzr branch/checkout
killed at inopportune moment) by cleaning the workspace and trying again
(this is now default behaviour, best used with the Jenkins SCM retry
count feature being > 1)
* New maintainer! Stewart Smith (me!)

[[BazaarPlugin-Version1.17(Aug11,2011)]]
=== Version 1.17 (Aug 11, 2011)

* Fix file descriptor leak in parsing ChangeLog.

* Fixed empty build changelog issue when using "clean build" option
(http://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-6761[JENKINS-6761])
* Fixed an issue with author parsing

[[BazaarPlugin-Version1.6]]

* Don't set master env variables on slaves for bazaar's getRevId; parse
only stdout when running revision-info -d, as stderr may get warnings.

[[BazaarPlugin-Version1.5]]
=== Version 1.5

* Updated plugin to use newer SCM API
* Fixed an issue with bzr probing on cloud-based builders where the
system needs to determine if it needs to create a builder, so it doesn't
have a builder, so it can't test against the state of the workspace on
the builder.

[[BazaarPlugin-Version1.4]]
=== Version 1.4

* Patch from zigarn. Prunes extraneous revision from changeset list.
* Fixes NPE on commit without changes. Patch from zigarn.
