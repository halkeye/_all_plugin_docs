== How to use this plugin ?

. You should install XML-RPC to your Trac, see
http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/XmlRpcPlugin.
. A member in your project should write Trac's ticket-id at the same
line including 'NOPMD'.
+
*Foo.java*

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
public void hoge(){
    something.wrongMethod(); //NOPMD #251
}
----
. And he or she writes "why using 'NOPMD' " into this ticket(i.e. 251 in
the above example).
. This plugin scans him or her code. And it connects to Tracand checks
that the ticket is closed. If this plugin finds 'NOPMD' without
ticket-id or finds ticket-id but this ticket isn't closed, this plugin
report that this 'NOPMD' is illegal.
