[.conf-macro .output-inline]#This plugin integrates Jenkins with
https://deveo.com/[Deveo].#

The plugin creates events to Deveo from Jenkins builds. The events can
then be seen in the activity feeds of Deveo projects. The plugin
supports Git, Subversion, and Mercurial.

[[DeveoPlugin-Configuringtheplugin]]
== Configuring the plugin

To allow Jenkins to send notifications to Deveo, you'll need to
configure two Deveo API keys for your Jenkins instance, namely Plugin
Key and Company Key. To do this, open up Jenkins System Configuration
(Manage Jenkins -> Configure System). There you'll find the Deveo
notifier section and under it inputs for the two keys. For Plugin Key
you can use the following: 3c94d47d6257ca0d3bc54a9b6a91aa64. You'll find
your Company Key from your Deveo User Preferences (User dropdown menu ->
Preferences) under API keys. Lastly, fill in the hostname of your Deveo
instance.

After you're done with the global plugin configuration, you'll need to
specify which Deveo account each job should utilize. To do this, open up
Job Configuration (Job -> Configure) and add a new Deveo Notification
Post-build Action. There you'll need to give the Account Key of the
Deveo account you want the job to utilize. This account is usually a bot
account. To create a bot, navigate to your Deveo project and click on
Settings and bot accounts. Now click on New bot to create a new bot.
Once you've created the bot, its details will be shown to you and you'll
find the bot's Account Key under API keys.
