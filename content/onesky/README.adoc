your onesky app and copy and pate the ending of your URL:

To the settings in your job: 

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/Screen_Shot_2016-11-28_at_17.22.42.png[image]#

Or your pipeline:

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/Screen_Shot_2016-11-28_at_17.23.42.png[image]#

The *Resources Path* will be configured in the same place:

on your job: +
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/Screen_Shot_2016-11-28_at_17.27.39.png[image]#

and on your pipeline:

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/Screen_Shot_2016-11-28_at_17.26.43.png[image]#

Finally, both the *API Secret* and *API key* should be taken from the
onesky app settings page:

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/settings.png[image]#

and saved in the global jenkins configuration:

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/Screen_Shot_2016-11-28_at_17.29.45.png[image]#
