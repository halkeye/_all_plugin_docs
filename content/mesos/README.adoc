[.conf-macro .output-inline]##The mesos-jenkins plugin allows Jenkins to
dynamically launch Jenkins slaves on a Mesos cluster depending on the
workload!##Put simply, whenever the Jenkins Build Queue starts getting
bigger, this plugin automatically spins up additional Jenkins slave(s)
on Mesos so that jobs can be immediately scheduled! Similarly, when a
Jenkins slave is idle for a long time it is automatically shut down.
