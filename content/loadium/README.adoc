Loadium is a cloud based performance test tool. You only need to connect
your Loadium account to Loadium Jenkins Plugin, configure a simple build
step to run your performance test. You can configure TeamCity to run the
Loadium build step whenever you want, and the test will start with your
pre-configured settings.
