Lucene-Search adds support to search for build data using the Jenkins
search box (aka quick navigation). The plugin stores the data after each
build in a search database.

[[Lucene-Search-Installation]]
== Installation

Install it as a normal plugin and all new builds will be searchable.

Before old builds can be searched, a "Rebuild database" must be
performed via the "Manage Jenkins" >>> "Lucene Search Manager". This
step should never have to be done again, but may take a long time if you
have many jobs and builds.

[[Lucene-Search-UpgradetoLucene-Search4.x]]
== Upgrade to Lucene-Search 4.x

Version 4.0 changed Lucene search engine from version 4 to version 5 so
you should recreate the Lucene database after upgrade.

[[Lucene-Search-Supportedkeywords]]
== *Supported keywords*

*console*: Console output  +
*projectdisplayname*: The project display name +
*projectname*: The project name +

*Solr*

The easiest way to get Solr up and running is by downloading the lastest
stable version (5.3.1 at the time of writing), unpack and do the
following:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
cd solr-5.3.1/example/example-schemaless
java -jar ../start.jar
----

Lucene-Search will set up the fields before it needs them. Adding fields
via extension points will require restarting jenkins or reconfiguring
the plugin (known bug).

[[Lucene-Search-Extensionpoint]]
=== *Extension point*

If you are a developer and want to add your own data to the database you
can implement the extension point "FreeTextSearchExtension". This will
allow the Lucene plugin to add your data to the database so it can be
searched. It is NOT an all or nothing deal, it's easy to support
Lucene-Search without requiring it.

[[Lucene-Search-Mavendependency]]

    <optional>true</optional> <!-- Only support, not require, lucene-search -->
</dependency>
----

The

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
<optional>true</optional>
----

is to only add support for Lucene-Search. This is for when you have a
plugin that can use Lucene-Search, but doesn't require it for the plugin
to work. If Lucene-Search is in the Jenkins instance at runtime, the
Lucene-Search plugin will use the extension points defined by the
plugin. If not, the ExtensionPoint will not cause any problems.

[[Lucene-Search-Example]]
==== Example

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
import org.jenkinsci.plugins.lucene.search.FreeTextSearchExtension;


@Extension
public class FitFreeTextSearchExtension extends FreeTextSearchExtension {

    @Override
    public String getKeyword() {
        return "fitsummary";
    }

    @Override
    public String getTextResult(AbstractBuild<?, ?> build) {
        StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();

        for (FitSummaryAction action : build.getActions(FitSummaryAction.class)) {
            builder.append(action.getSummary() + "\n");
        }

        return builder.toString();

    }

    @Override
    public boolean isPersist() {
        return true;
    }

}

[[Lucene-Search-Comingchanges(completed/prioritized)]]
=== Coming changes (completed/prioritized)

Planned

. Improve console hightlightings. "(exit code: 1)" hightlights the word
code and the number 1. Would be better if we only hightlight the full
match. -Command completed with *code* 0
. Paginating results.
. Find a solution for  the
bugs https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-30325[JENKINS-30325] and https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-30665?filter=-2[30665] where
we can not use Lucene without "XX:-UseSplitVerifier" after Jenkins 1.602

==== The Lucene lib used by this plugin requires that we run Jenkins with Java 7 or later. However due to a bug in Jenkins byte code this plugin will not work if you use Java 8 with a Jenkins version later then 1.601. If you are running on a newer version you will need to run with Java 7 and add the java argument XX:-UseSplitVerifier when starting Jenkins or you will be unable to use the search function.

[[Lucene-Search-Example.1]]
==== Example

JAVA_OPTS="XX:-UseSplitVerifier"

*How to search*

Just a type a string in the search box to search. If you do not include
a suffix the search plugin will search in all keywords bellow not marked
with a *. If you want to search for a string in a specific field just
add the write <KEYWORDS>:<VALUE>.

[[Lucene-Search-IndexWriterislocked]]
=== IndexWriter is locked

This problem is seen for several reasons +
* The lucene folder on the Jenkins server has invalid user permisions,
change the read/write permisions and reconfigure Lucene/restart the
Jenkins server +
* Out of permgen memory on Jenkins +
* The solr server has crashed, often as you don't have enough memory on
the server.
