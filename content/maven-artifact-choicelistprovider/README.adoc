[[MavenArtifactChoiceListProviderPlugin-Whatisthis?]]
=== What is this?

This Plugin adds an additional ChoiceListProvider to famous
https://plugins.jenkins.io/extensible-choice-parameter[Extensible Choice
Parameter] Plugin.

With this extension its possible to use the Service API from a Maven
Repositories like Nexus, Maven-Central or Artifactory to search for
artifacts using groupId, artifactId and packaging.

This plugin will let the user choose a version from the available
artifacts in the repository and will publish the URL as an environment
variable. The Plugin will return the full URL of the choosen artifact,
so that it will be available during the build, i.E. you can retrieve the
artifact by using "wget"

[[MavenArtifactChoiceListProviderPlugin-Example]]
==== Example

We are using this plugin to let our QA department choose between the
various versions of our software which then is downloaded and installed
on the test environment.

[[MavenArtifactChoiceListProviderPlugin-Nexus3]]
==== Nexus 3

Since Nexus 3.15.x the RESTful search service is available by a
different URL. In the current plugin version this new URL is used. If
you are using an older Nexus 3 instance you have to use the plugin in
version 1.3.4

[[MavenArtifactChoiceListProviderPlugin-NexusSnapshots]]
==== Nexus Snapshots

If you would like to use Snapshot Versions of your artifacts you have to
enable the tick-box in the Jenkins Settings. Only with the RESTful
interface of Nexus 2 you will be able to retrieve Snapshot versions.

[[MavenArtifactChoiceListProviderPlugin-Artifactory]]
==== Artifactory

Artifactory API is not returning the correct ArtifactIds but only a URL
to a JSON file that contains the DownloadURI of the Artifact. As
currently there is no way in the Extensible Choice Plugin to intercept
the selected value and because its not performant to query Artifactory
for all items in the list for the correct downloadURI, the workaround is
like this:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
wget `wget -qO - https://repo.jenkins-ci.org/api/storage/releases/org/jenkins-ci/plugins/ant-in-workspace/1.1.0/ant-in-workspace-1.1.0-javadoc.jar | json downloadUri`
----

The json command like tool is required:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
json --version
json 9.0.6

[[MavenArtifactChoiceListProviderPlugin-15.Februar2017-1.1.3]]
==== 15. Februar 2017 - 1.1.3

* FIX: Caching of ChoiceList Parameters leads to the point, that you
have to reconfigure the job first before new values are available in the
list. This implicit caching is now taken out.

[[MavenArtifactChoiceListProviderPlugin-18.Januar2017-1.1.1]]
==== 18. Januar 2017 - 1.1.1

[[MavenArtifactChoiceListProviderPlugin-13.January2017-1.0.4]]
==== 13. January 2017 - 1.0.4

URL was constructed to target the file directly in the repository. The
new implementation makes use of the RESTful service of Nexus to retrieve
an artifact. This has the advantage, that also Snapshot versions can be
retrieved.

Only preparation, as i dont have a solution how to change build
environments once the build has been started.

[[MavenArtifactChoiceListProviderPlugin-25.July2016-0.0.8]]

* Added Checkbox to have the response list in reverse order
