This plugin show information about jobs, slaves and the queue in
Jenkins.

The JQS-Monitoring Plugin makes it possible to monitor what is happening
in the job queue, what is the status of each slave or each job that is
being build at the moment. You can also get information about the number
of failed builds for the last 24 hours in a histogram graphic. With the
plugin you can easily detect if a job is stuck in the queue or being
built for too long. The information for the different components can be
viewed separately in single pages or simultaneously in one big page. The
links to this pages can be found in the left menu-panel of the plugin.

This menu-panel also contains a link to the configuration page, where a
number of options can be configured to change the way information is
shown(size, color, hide/show options).
