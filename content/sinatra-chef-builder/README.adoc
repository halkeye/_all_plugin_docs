[[ChefSinatraJenkinsPlugin-Summary:]]
== *Summary**:*

The plugin allows the auto code deployment when specific package is
ready to all the assigned nodes based on the Sinatra app running in
background.

*Detail Description*: At times when we do the auto code deployment using
chef configuration management tool, "chef-client" OR any another command
for that matter (E.x. : knife bootstrap) needs to be executed on the
remote hosts as per the configuration of run list. This plugin provides
the interface and several options to configure the behavior on how to
perform the deployment.

*Use case*:

* The plugin is useful when code needs to be deployed on multiple nodes
in parallel OR sequential.
* runs on-demand or scheduled "chef-client" OR any command on selected
nodes as per configuration.
* generates the report as a post build action once the deployment
completes. This is TODO
