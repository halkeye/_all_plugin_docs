This plugin records disk usage.

[[DiskUsagePlugin-Configuration]]
== Configuration

Showing disk usage trend graph is optional - unselect the "Show disk
usage trend graph" checkbox on the global configuration page ("Manage
Jenkins" -> "System configuration") if you don't want to see the graph
on the project page.

[[DiskUsagePlugin-Usage]]
== Usage

When you install this plugin, disk usage is calculated each 60 minutes.
You can see project list with occupied disk space by going to the "Disk
Usage" page in the management section (Dashboard -> "Manage Jenkins" ->
"Disk Usage"). The same page also allows you to schedule disk usage
calculation immediately.

More detailed information can be seen on the project page, where you can
find disk usage for each build and workspace, as well as a graph with
disk usage trend.
