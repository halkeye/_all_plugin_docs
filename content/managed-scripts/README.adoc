Managed scripts are shell scripts which are managed centrally by an
administrator and can be referenced as a build step within jobs.

[[ManagedScriptPlugin-Description]]
== Description

The scripts are managed by the
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Config+File+Provider+Plugin[Config
File Provider Plugin], go to the "Manage Jenkins" screen and click on
the "Managed files" item.

After installing the "Managed Scripts" plugin, you have a new option to
create a managed script in the type list.

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/screen-capture-1.jpg[image]#

Now you get to the screen to create your script. You're able to give it
a name and a small description. In addition, you have the option to
define a list of arguments you want to inform the users about. These
arguments will be shown to the user as a hint and within the script
you're able to reference these as if you would pass in arguments on the
command line ($1, $2,...). Every environment variable from within a
build will be visible to the script, too.

Within the job, a user is able to select the required script from a
drop-down menu. The defined parameters are shown in respect to the
selected script. The link enables the user to have a read-only look at
the script.
