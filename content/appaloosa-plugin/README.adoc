[[AppaloosaPlugin-Settingupapostbuildstep]]
==== Setting up a post build step

In your job configuration, check the post-build action "Upload to
appaloosa" +
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/appaosa-screenshot_1.png[image]#

Add your store token and customize the pattern if needed. +
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/screenshot-appaloosa-plugin-config.png[image]#

You can find your store token on the 'settings page':
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/Screen_Shot_2012-04-13_at_20.13.38_.png[image]# +
 (you have to be an administrator to see this page). +
The default pattern will upload all .IPA and .APK files in your
workspace. Builds usually generate only one artifact, the default
pattern will suit theses cases.
