Use Containers to setup build agents, without any constraint on images
you can use.

[[DockerSlavesPlugin-Objectives]]
== Objectives

- [✓] use ANY docker image, without any jenkins-specific prerequisite

- [✓] no SSHD inside container, no JNLP port exposed over the Internet

- [✓] compose your build _à la_ docker-compose with a main build
container and sidecar containers for test database, selenium browser,
etc

- [✓] define container used for the build as a Dockerfile stored in
project SCM - aka "_continuous delivery as code_"

- [✓] support Pipeline

- [✓] rely on docker volumes to offer workspace persistence between
builds

- [✓] extensibility for various docker hosting solutions

[[DockerSlavesPlugin-Configuration]]
== Configuration

In your jobs, new option let you define your build environment as a
combination of Docker images / Dockerfiles  +

[[DockerSlavesPlugin-History]]
== History

[[DockerSlavesPlugin-1.0.2]]
=== 1.0.2

Fix support for Docker host credentials +
Add support for docker socket bind mount via a dedicated binding
container. This let you run `docker build` from your build container

[[DockerSlavesPlugin-1.0.1]]
=== 1.0.1

Plugin has been moved to jenkinsci github organization so we can publish
it in public update center

[[DockerSlavesPlugin-0.5-proofofconcept]]
=== 0.5 - proof of concept

This version has been released at DevoxxFrance while we demonstrated the
plugin, so people can give it a try and let us know if it was useful

[[DockerSlavesPlugin-Why?]]
== Why ?

Why (yet another) Docker plugin ?

Most plugins around use docker as a lightweight virtual machine, but
don't embrace containers paradigm shift and how they impact CI/CD. 

This plugin has been designed as a pure experiment
during https://www.docker.com/community/hackathon[Docker Global Hack
Day]. It's under active development. Plugin authors are CloudBees
employees, but the plugin isn't a CloudBees product, please consider
this as individuals public experiment.

*Diagnostic*

If something goes wrong (sic), please first run Jenkins master with
`+-Dit.dockins.dockerslaves.spi.DockerDriver.verbose=true+` . This will
dump in build log all docker commands ran by the plugin and help us
understand the issue.

Then, ask for assistance on jenkins-users mailing list and/or report a
bug on https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/[https://issues.jenkins-ci.org]

[[DockerSlavesPlugin-Future]]
== Future

There's many possible improvements / features we'd like to experiment.

* integrate with Pipeline plugin, especially replace DurableTask by a
docker based implementation, running docker commands detached (-d) and
polling using docker API for execution status. Would need some way to
replace the `+sh+` step execution
* consider using a java based docker client for Docker API, so we don't
rely on running external commands (and related threads usage)
* integrate with docker orchestrators (amazon ECS, Kubernetes, Hyper_
...) as an alternative backend
* offer isolated Docker host per build, typically relying on docker
inside LXD containers.
* Let build use of docker as part of the build (i.e. bind mount
docker.sock in build container)
* experiment with docker volume plugins (flocker) for workspace
snapshoting and offline browsing of the exact workspace for a specific
build.
* experiment pipeline support for volumes
* support docker 1.12 swarm mode
https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-38203[JENKINS-38203]
* expose docker.sock so build can run `doker build` (aka "inception")
https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-37088[JENKINS-37088]
