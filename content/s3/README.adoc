[[S3Plugin-Makingartifactspublic]]
== Making artifacts public

If you'd like to have all of your artifacts be publicly downloadable,
seeÂ http://ariejan.net/2010/12/24/public-readable-amazon-s3-bucket-policy/.

[[S3Plugin-UsagewithIAM]]
== Usage with IAM

If you used IAM to create a separate pair of access credentials for this
plugin, you can lock down its AWS access to simply listing buckets and
writing to a specific bucket. Add the following custom policy to the
user in the IAM console, replacing occurrences of "my-artifact-bucket"
with your bucket name, which you'll have to create first:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
{
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
        "s3:ListAllMyBuckets"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::*"
    },
    {
      "Action": "s3:*",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::my-artifact-bucket", "arn:aws:s3:::my-artifact-bucket/*"]
    }
  ]
}
