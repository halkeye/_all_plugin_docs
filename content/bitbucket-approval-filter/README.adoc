This plugin works along with
the https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Bitbucket+Branch+Source+Plugin[Bitbucket
Branch Source Plugin] and allows filtering out pull requests based on
their approval status. 

Note: There is a known issue with using the Basic Branch Build
Strategies Plugin with named branches not building when using this
plugin.

The different approval statuses supported are: 

* No Approval Necessary
** This is the same behavior as not having the plugin installed.
Approvals have no affect on whether a pull request will be built or not.
* Any Approval Required
** Before being built a pull request must have an approval, this
approval could come from the author of the Pull Request.
* Non-Author Approval Required
** Before being built a pull request must have an approval that is from
a user that is not the author.
