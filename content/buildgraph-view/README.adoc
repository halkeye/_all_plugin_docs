This plugin computes a graph of related builds starting from the current
one, and render it as a graph.

Downstream builds are identified by DownStreamRunDeclarer extension
point.

* Default one is using Jenkins dependencyGraph and UpstreamCause and as
such can detect common build chain.
* https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Build+Flow+Plugin[build-flow] plugin
is contributing one to render flow execution as a graph
* some Jenkins plugins may later contribute dedicated solutions.

Note: due to
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Join+Plugin[Join plugin]'s
design, join jobs appear concurrently to other downstream jobs, not as
being triggered subsequently.
