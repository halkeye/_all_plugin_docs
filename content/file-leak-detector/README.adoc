Runtime diagnosis tool for "too many open files" problem.This plugin
watches file descriptor open/close activities of JVM and allow you to
see the list of what's currently opened, and Java call stack that opened
the file. If you are suffering from the
https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/I%27m+getting+too+many+open+files+error[too
many open files] problem, this report enables the developers to fix the
leak.

[[FileLeakDetectorPlugin-Usage]]
== Usage

This plugin adds "Open File Handles" item in the "Manage Jenkins" page.
Go to this page and click "activate" button to activate the monitoring.
Once this is done, a Java agent is installed on the JVM and starts
monitoring new file open/close activities. Revisit the "Open File
Handles" page and you'll see the currently opened files.

To help the developers, activate this, and let Jenkins run for a while,
then come back and capture the report and attach it to a ticket. Do get
a few reports with intervals of 10 mins or so, so that we can
distinguish real leaks from false positives.
