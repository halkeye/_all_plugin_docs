Simulate File System as SCM by checking file system last modified date,
checkout(), pollChanges(), ChangeLog and distributed build are all
supported.

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/screenshot.png[image]#

Folder difference is found by

. for each file in source, check if the corresponding file in workspace
exists
.. if not, it is a new file
.. if yes, further checks if the file in source is newer than file in
workspace, or if source file is modified since last build, this is a
modified file
. for each file in workspace, if the corresponding file in source does
not exist AND
.. it is in our self maintained "allow delete list", we will delete this
file from workspace. Every times we copy a file from src to dst, we add
the filename to the "allow delete list", in other words, we will only
delete files that are copied by us

Filtering is supported when checking for modified files.

If *_Clear Workspace_* is checked, the system will delete all existing
files/sub-folders in workspace before checking-out. Poll changes will
not be affected by this setting.

In Changelog, *_User_*, i.e. who changed the file, is not supported.
