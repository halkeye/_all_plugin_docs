This plugin allows SCM-triggered jobs to ignore build requests if only
certain paths have changed, or to build if and only if certain paths are
changed.

[[PathignorePlugin-Description]]
== Description

Pathignore allows you to do one of two things:

. Do NOT allow a build to run if *ALL* of the changed paths match a
given set of patterns.
* This allows you to ignore specific paths, not triggering a build if
only the specified paths have changed.
. Only allow a build to run if at least *ONE* of the files changed match
a given set of patterns.
* This allows you to only build for specific paths, not triggering a
build if the paths you care about haven't changed.

[[PathignorePlugin-Setup]]
=== Setup

To filter whether a build builds based on path, go to the configuration
page of the job you care about, and check the box named
`+Do not build if only specified paths have changed+`.

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/pathignore-screenshot.png[image]#

The default mode will not rebuild if only the specified paths have
changed. The "inverted" mode will do #2 above, and only build if the
specific paths have changed.

Patterns are separated by comma, and matched using
http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/File.html#method-c-fnmatch[Ruby's
fnmatch].

A skipped build will be marked as NOT BUILT, not FAILED or SUCCESS.
