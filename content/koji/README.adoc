This plugin enables integration with
https://fedorahosted.org/koji/[Koji] build system providing clean-room
environment for production builds. Main focus of Koji is on
reproducibility, auditability and isolation of build executors which are
freshly provisioned each time.

This plugin focuses on Koji/Maven builds, however if there will be
requirements to work with RPM builds, Windows native builds or images in
the future, I can add the support as well and of course I will accept
your contributions.

You can use https://github.com/sbadakhc/kojak[Kojak] scripts to easily
provision & automatically configure your own Koji instance including
configuration of the Java/maven ecosystem.

A potential usage of Jenkins-Koji plugin can be described as such:

* Run your builds using Jenkins CI, as you do now
* Once build & tests are passing and you are ready to produce a
production build call Jenkins-Koji build step
* Jenkins-Koji plugin orchestrates the jobs in Koji, you can choose a
"scratch build" which is a temporary build which is garbage collected
after a time 
* Once Koji is finished, use Jenkins-Koji plugin to automatically fetch
the artifacts from Koji and for example run a set of smoke tests
* Once these advanced tests pass, you are ready for a full build, once
again execute Koji build, this time a regular build, which will be
stored permanently in Koji

Installation Requirements

#

Currently this plugin requires koji CLI installed on the filesystem,
limiting usage to Linux. In time the functionality of koji CLI will be
transfered to core plugin, allowing execution from various OSes.

[[KojiPlugin-Description]]
== Description

Koji plugin is meant for orchestration of Koji instance from Jenkins CI.
The idea is to use Jenkins as a developer tool and build the production
releases via Koji.

The following features are provided by this plug-in:

* Orchestrate a Koji maven build
* Collect the results from Koji
* Find metadata about builds, packages or build targets from Koji
* Simple authentication

. Install Koji CLI on your system (yum install koji)
. Configure the Koji CLI to use your SSH key for Koji instance 
. Install the Koji plugin in Jenkins
. Restart Jenkins
. Execute Koji-plugin in Jenkins as you desire

[[KojiPlugin-Roadmap]]
== Roadmap

* Eliminate usage of Koji CLI to enable support for multiplatform
Jenkins executors
* Revamp of Jelly UI
* Provide more operations
* Include rule based decisions for Koji builds based on test results /
successful executions 
* Try to provide authentication via SSL or Kerberos if desired by
community
* Enable basic operations for RPMs
