This plugin enables administrators to reserve executors to be used
outside Jenkins.

It is useful for making Jenkins aware of activities outside Jenkins â€”
such as when you are using people's workstations as slaves (which need
to be available for interactive use during day time) or when the system
goes through a periodical backup, which reduces the I/O capability of
the system.

By default, the reservation is specified in a cron-like syntax (but as
you see below, this is an extension point.)

More specifically, you specify (1) an integer to decide the number of
executors reserved (or special token "*" to indicate all the executors
of the node), (2) a cron syntax to decide when a reservation starts, (3)
number of minutes that decide the duration. So for example, to reserve 2
executors between 8am-5pm weekdays, you'd write the following:

....
# 5pm - 8am = 9hours = 540mins
2 : 0 8 * * 1-5 : 540
# or alternatively devide it up to 9 times 1hr reservation
2 : 0 8-16 * * 1-5 : 60
....

== Extension Points

This plugin provides an extension point that allows other plugins to
control the reservation programmatically (or by exposing it in a
different UI.) For example, one might consider controlling reservations
via existing calendar system such as Microsoft Exchange, or provide a
simpler UI for common cases.
