vulnerabilities]

Global build stats plugin will allow to gather and display global build
result statistics. +
It is a useful tool allowing to display global jenkins/hudson build
trend over time.

[[GlobalBuildStatsPlugin-Requirements]]
== Requirements

Since v1.1, Global build stats plugin requires Jenkins 1.398 or higher.

Before v1.0, Global build stats plugin requires Jenkins/Hudson 1.339 or
higher.

[[GlobalBuildStatsPlugin-Installation]]
== Installation

To install Global build stats Plugin, Go to the "plugin management"
section in the administration Panel. +
Latest released version will be available. Install it from there (you
should need to restart Jenkins/Hudson after that).

To verify that the plugin is well installed, go to the Administration
panel : you should see an icon with mister Jenkins/Hudson and a graph on
it : +
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/global-build-stats.png[image]# or 
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/global-build-stats-old.png[image]#

Then you can click it and access the global build stats config panel.

[[GlobalBuildStatsPlugin-Usage]]
== Usage

The global build stats main screen is made of different sections :

* On the left side : Action links
* On the center : Charts displaying global build statistics & action
buttons (update, move & delete)
* On the bottom : Data initialization +
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/GlobalBuildStats-MainScreen_-_Init.png[image]#

[[GlobalBuildStatsPlugin-Actionlinks]]
=== Action links

4 links are availables :

* Back to dashboard : Navigation link allowing to go back to
Jenkins/Hudson root URL
* Create new chart : Display a popup form to create a new Chart. See the
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Global+Build+Stats+Plugin#GlobalBuildStatsPlugin-chartcreationupdate[Create
/ Update a chart section].
* Manage retention strategies. See the
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Global+Build+Stats+Plugin#GlobalBuildStatsPlugin-retentionStrategies[Manage
retention strategies section].
* Data Initialization : Useful to initialize your global build stats
data, especially just after Global build stats first installation. See
the
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Global+Build+Stats+Plugin#GlobalBuildStatsPlugin-datainitialization[Data
Initialization Section].

[#GlobalBuildStatsPlugin-datainitialization .confluence-anchor-link .conf-macro .output-inline]#
#

[[GlobalBuildStatsPlugin-DataInitialization]]
=== Data Initialization

If you click on this button, all of your existing persisted build
results will be gathered. +
This is particularly useful to initialize statistics in a first step. +
Note that data initialization gathering is only based on "recordable"
data. If you frequently purged your job results, data will no longer be
available for gathering. Nevertheless, once data has been initialized in
global-build-stats, it will be made available even if data is purged
(result data is cloned in the global-build-stats.xml file). +
Starting from 0.1 (and greater ones), you can perform several data
initializations : existing global-build-stats.xml will be merged against
eventually new gathered data.

Take into account the following only if you are using a 0.1-alphaX
version of global-build-stats plugin (for greater versions, data are
merged and thus, never lost) : +
*Beware* : this should be done only once because :

* Statistics are automatically updated after each build
* "not recoverable" statistics (for example, if you check the "delete
old builds" checkbox on job configuration) will be lost if you click
this button

[#GlobalBuildStatsPlugin-retentionStrategies .confluence-anchor-link .conf-macro .output-inline]#
#

[[GlobalBuildStatsPlugin-Manageretentionstrategies]]
=== Manage retention strategies

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/configuringRetentionStrategies.png[image]#

This section is for customizing job build result retention for
global-build-stats plugin. +
Job build result is the largest data stored in global build stats
configuration files (in global-build-stats.xml or
global-build-stats/jobResults/*). That is to say, if you're expecting
some disk consumption issue, a workaround would be to be stricter on the
job build result retention strategies.

Warning

[.aui-icon .aui-icon-small .aui-iconfont-warning .confluence-information-macro-icon]#
#

Using retention strategies will delete *permanently* job build results.
Thus, you won't be able to retrieve them. +
Take this functionality with care.

Prior to version 1.2, 3 retention strategies are available :

* Automatically discard results older than X days : as mentioned, by
checking this strategy, a daily purge process will be executed to clean
oldy job build results stored
* Keep existing job results only : by checking this strategy, a purge
will be triggered *only once* (when submitting the form) that will
ensure every global-build-stats stored build results correspond to an
*existing* (ie not purged) build result.
* Do not keep build results when they are discarded : by checking this
strategy, every time someone will delete a build or a job, corresponding
job results stored by global build stats will be deleted. This strategy
is different than "keep existing job result only" strategy since it
won't affect job results stored in the past. Moreover, it is a strategy
that will be triggered regularly (instead of only once for "keep
existing job results only").

[#GlobalBuildStatsPlugin-chartcreationupdate .confluence-anchor-link .conf-macro .output-inline]#
#

[[GlobalBuildStatsPlugin-BuildstatsChartCreation/Update]]
=== Build stats Chart Creation / Update

In this popup form, you can create a new Build Stats Chart. +
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/GlobalBuildStats_-_ChartCreation.png[image]#

Here are some details on the different parameters :

* Chart title : Title displayed on top of the Chart
* Chart size : Width & Height (in pixels) of the created chart
* Chart Scale : Unit of chart X axis. Either Year, Month, Week, Day or
Hour. Difference between "XXX" and "XXX From now" concerns the X axis
ranges. If current datetime is 2010/10/27 3:00 PM and selected chart
scale is "daily", last date ranges on X axis will be [ 2010/10/26 00:00
AM -> 2010/10/27 00:00 AM ] and [ 2010/10/27 00:00 AM -> 2010/10/27 3:00
PM ]. If "daily from now" were selected, we would have [ 2010/10/25 3:00
PM -> 2010/10/26 3:00 PM ] and [ 2010/10/26 3:00 PM -> 2010/10/27 3:00
PM ]
* Chart Length : Number of steps (ticks) on X axis. Unit used depends on
selected chart scale.
* Job filtering : Either All jobs (no filtering) or a job name regex
(syntax is the same than the one used by
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html[Pattern
class]
* Node filtering : Either All nodes (no filtering), master node, or a
node name regex (syntax is the same than the one used by
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html[Pattern
class]
* Launcher filtering : Filtering on user who launched the build. System
user is used when performing triggered non manual builds, so if you want
to display "automatic" (=non manual) builds, check the "System only"
radio button. The user name regex syntax is the same than the one used
by
http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html[Pattern
class]
* Statuses filtering : Success, Failures, Unstables, Aborted or Not
Build builds. Not that "not build" statuses are unchecked by default :
this status is special since sometimes, on a successful maven multi
module project, module builds are marked as "not build" (unknown reason)
* Elements displayed on chart. I call these elements "dimensions" :
** Build statuses : will show build count (or percentage) for each
selected build statuses
** Total build time : will display total cumulated build time on each
time ranges. This functionality could be useful to determine the cost of
an externalization in a "Jenkins/Hudson as a Service" platform like
http://www.cloudbees.com/[cloudbees]
** Average build time : will display average cumulated build time on
each time ranges

All fields are mandatory. Chart's width, height & length should be
integers. +
*If at least 1 server-side validation fails, form will not be
"submittable".*

Before submitting the form, you can have a look at the future chart
which will be displayed by clicking the "overview" button.

[[GlobalBuildStatsPlugin-BuildstatsChartdisplay]]
=== Build stats Chart display

This section displays every persisted Chart Configurations. +
You can, too, edit, delete or move up/down these graphs. +
Graphs are created using REST-like URL so that you can export this URLs
into your favourite Portal or CMS (or Jenkins/Hudson dashboard). +
2 chart examples can be seen below : +
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/GlobalBuildStats_-_Last30Days.png[image]# +
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/GlobalBuildStats_-_Last15Weeks.png[image]#

Last chart displays the 3 available dimensions altogether (result
counts, total build time & average build time).

By clicking a results counts region, you will be redirected on the build
search engine screen. +
See the Build Search engine section for further details.

Near every build chart, you'll have at least two button : edit & delete
buttons. +
Depending of the placement of your chart, you'll be able to "move
up/down" the chart.

[[GlobalBuildStatsPlugin-Notesaboutuser&nodefiltering]]
==== Notes about user & node filtering

Warning

[.aui-icon .aui-icon-small .aui-iconfont-warning .confluence-information-macro-icon]#
#

Don't expect to have relevant results just after an upgrade between :

* pre and post 0.4 versions for node filtering
* pre and post 1.0 versions for user filtering

When migrating, only not purged data (concerning node & user having
launched the build) will be recorded. +
That is, "old" data (such as builds executed a few weeks ago) won't be
available.

Starting from your plugin upgrade, full data will obviously be recorded.

[[GlobalBuildStatsPlugin-Notesaboutdurationsdisplayedwhenmigratingtov0.5]]
==== Notes about durations displayed when migrating to v0.5

Warning

[.aui-icon .aui-icon-small .aui-iconfont-warning .confluence-information-macro-icon]#
#

For the same reasons as above, don't expect to have relevant results
just after an upgrade between pre and post 0.5 versions : you'll have to
wait a few times in order to have sufficient data amount to calculate
total & average build duration.

[[GlobalBuildStatsPlugin-Buildsearchengine]]
=== Build search engine

The build search engine is accessible by clicking a build result region
on a chart. +
It will provide search criteria to query the global-build-stats build
results on different ways : result status, job name, node name and date
ranges. +
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/GlobalBuildStats_-_BuildSearchEngine.png[image]#

Result sort order can be changed by clicking the table headers. +
If build result has not been purged, a clickable link will be displayed
to navigate through the console output & the detailed build result.

Identified issues : +
https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-7241[JENKINS-7241]: Special
characters in chart title ("é" for example) are not well filling
textfields in edit form +
Fix legend item sorting (for now, sort depends on alphabetical order...
that's why statuses are prefixed with "1), 2).." +
Fix date displayed on build search view, due to yui calendars +
Rename persisted node names in global-build-stats.xml after node is
renamed

Features : +
Test global build stat behaviour under IE & Safari +
Cache chart renderings (provide a checkbox in the
buildStatConfiguration, allowing to enable chart caching with a given
refresh rate based on selected time scale). Chart rendering will cache
chart in-memory (thus it will consume a little bit more memory) but will
reduce the CPU used when displaying the chart. It feets particularly
well if you decide to "share" your chart with lots of users that will
want to display it (on the jenkins/hudson welcome screen for example) +
In build search results, allow to limit number of results (radio button
allowing "unlimited" and "limited to XXX results") +
Allow to select build start or build end for stats gathering (build end
could be calculated with build start + duration). For now, we use only
build start +
(if possible) Allow to click on a date to display date builds (no matter
the build result) +
If possible, provide tooltips on chart, displaying the 10 first job
names matching with the current hovered region

* Fixed encoding of special characters ("é" for example) in chart title

[[GlobalBuildStatsPlugin-Improvements.5]]
==== Improvements

* Provided data migration tool API to migrate from different versions of
the persisted plugin data (it will be easier to migrate from one version
to another)
* Optimized global-build-stats.xml file size (1.5Mo for 8600 build
results) => Reduced by half thanks to xstream aliases
* *UI Greatly improved by doing AJAX calls* :
