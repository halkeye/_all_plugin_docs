This plugin allows you to add some links from a text file to the sidebar
at every build.

 +
The data are obtained from a user selected file in a working directory.
The structure of the file is as follows:

* each line in file describes one link to be added to the sidebar
* each line must contain three fields divided by tabs: *name, url,
icon*. One can omit icon field to use default.

AnchorChain complains to console log for any issues.
