[.conf-macro .output-inline]#This plugin allows you to send these
metrics : number of tests, tests skipped, tests failed, build duration,
cobertura total line coverage  +
and cobertura total branch coverage to one or more graphite servers. +
If you don't have a graphite server you can use :
https://www.hostedgraphite.com/[https://www.hostedgraphite.com] to
test. +
   +
For cobertura metrics you need to install cobertura plugin and run
cobertura:cobertura in goals section. +

Be sure to run jenkins your jobs with a Jdk 7 (go to the manage jenkins
+ configure system + Jdk installations ), because the plugin only works
with this version of jdk.#
