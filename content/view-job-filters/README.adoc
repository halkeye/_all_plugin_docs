Create smart views with exactly the jobs you want. Your smart views can
automatically include or exclude jobs by using things like the SCM path
or type, the job type, build statuses or trends or triggers, relevance
to the logged-in user, email recipients, Maven configuration, job
parameterization, and user permissions. Mix and match filters to narrow
down to exactly what you want.

[[ViewJobFilters-Whatisthe"ViewJobFilters"plugin?]]
== What is the "View Job Filters" plugin?

This plugin provides a number of filters that you can
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Using+the+View+Job+Filters+Match+Type["chain"
together] to provide a much easier way to create views to organize
hundreds of jobs.  For each filter type, you can add multiple filters,
and combine them with filters of other types.  For example, you can
create a view of all your nightly jobs except those not under any SCM. 
In a nutshell, this plugin provides the following:

* Create view to manage hundreds of jobs by

[[ViewJobFilters-HowdoIgetstarted?]]
== How do I get started?

* https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Plugins[Install the
plugin]
* If needed, create a new view (besides the All view) by clicking the
"+" tab
** You might optionally want to see
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Editing+or+Replacing+the+All+View[Editing
or Replacing the All View] - the default "All" view is not editable
* If editing an existing view, click the "Edit View" link (won't be
available for the "All" view)
* You will see the following button in the "Job Filters" section. Click
it to select and add the filter type(s) you want. +

[[ViewJobFilters-RegularExpressionJobFilter]]
== Regular Expression Job Filter

With a large organization and hundreds of jobs, it will become very
annoying and time-consuming to try to keep your views organized.  The
regular expression job filter can help, and there are multiple options
to choose from to make it easier.

* *Include/Exclude options* - ability to either add jobs or filter out
jobs based on the expression, or the negation of the expression
* *Job name* - allows you to filter out jobs when you have naming
conventions.  Also allows you to "narrow down" other filters, or to
match the negation of an expression
* *Job description* - if you use descriptions, this may help you get
what you want
* *SCM Configuration* - this one is perhaps the best bang for the buck -
put in something like ".*/my-office-name/.*" to automatically include
all jobs that are organized under source control already by office.
* *Maven Configuration* - looks at all your Maven goals, including
freestyle projects, matrix (multi-configuration) projects, Maven
projects, and Maven extra steps.
* *Email Recipients* - a great way to organize views by "who cares about
this job".  Will look in either the standard email publisher or the
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Email-ext+plugin[extended
email publisher]
* *Job Schedule* - searches the chron spec and description to group jobs
by when they run - for example "weekend jobs"
* *Node/Slave Label* - matches against the Label Expression under the
"Restrict where this project can be run" option

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/RegExJobFilter.png[image]#

[[ViewJobFilters-FilterbyRelevancetoLogged-inUser]]
== Filter by Relevance to Logged-in User

Create views that are most relevant to the logged-in user.

The "*Name Matching*" checkbox items are to allow you to get the name
matching just right. The problem is that organizations often have
different naming conventions that may not be consistent across version
control, network logins, and email addresses. All of the options are
checked by default so that this filter can make a thorough effort to
find matching users.

The "*Relevance Matching*" options should be self explanatory. The point
is to try and find all jobs that the logged in user cares about, based
on their activity.

For the "How far back to check" value, use either "0" or blank to
indicate you want to check all builds.

Note that not all combinations of criteria will make sense. Also take a
look at the
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/View+Job+Filters#ViewJobFilters-UserPermissionsforJobs[User
permissions for Jobs] filter.

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/view-job-filters-UserRelevanceFilter.PNG[image]#

[[ViewJobFilters-FilterbyJobStatuses]]
== Filter by Job Statuses

This filter provides a number of options, and you can also add multiple
of these filters, and choose different Match Types to include/exclude
exactly the jobs you want.  For example, you could create "Failed Jobs
Only" and "Unstable Jobs Only" views, or make a more complicated view
like the following example combination.

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/JobStatusesFilter.png[image]#

[[ViewJobFilters-FilterbyBuildStatuses]]
== Filter by Build Statuses

This filter gets a little more specific, and provides options to filter
by the status of the job's builds.  This example filters out (excludes)
all jobs that have never built.

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/BuildStatusesFilter.png[image]#

[[ViewJobFilters-FilterbyBuildTrend]]
== Filter by Build Trend

This filter is similar to the build status filter, but it takes into
account the time in which the status changed.

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/view-job-filters-BuildTrendFilter.PNG[image]#

The different Build trend types are

* The latest build was
* At least one build was
* All builds were
* Completed, Started, Stable, Unstable, Failed, Not Stable
* Triggered by Timer, SCM, User, Remote, Upstream Job, CLI

The different "how far back to check" types include, "Days", "Hours" and
"Builds".

[[ViewJobFilters-FilterbySCMType]]
== Filter by SCM Type

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/SCM-Filter-Type.PNG[image]#

[[ViewJobFilters-FilterbytheJobsinOtherViews]]
== Filter by the Jobs in Other Views

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/OtherViewsFilter.PNG[image]#

[[ViewJobFilters-FilterbyJobParameterization]]
== Filter by Job Parameterization

Use Regular Expressions to include or exclude parameterized jobs based
on their build parameters. +
Match the parameter name, build value, or description. Alternately, you
may opt to depend on the default configured value.

For the name, value, and description - a blank indicates you do not care
about that field - it behaves as if you had assigned it the regular
expression ".*".

This filter works with String, Boolean, File, Choice, and Validating
String parameter types.

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/Parameterized-Jobs-Filter.PNG[image]#

[[ViewJobFilters-UserPermissionsforJobs]]
== User Permissions for Jobs

Use this feature in tandem with security features such as the
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Standard+Security+Setup[Standard
matrix based security] to create views that show different jobs
depending on who is logged in.

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/view-job-filters-user-permissions.PNG[image]#

[[ViewJobFilters-Filterjobsthathaveenabledproject-basedsecurity]]
== Filter jobs that have enabled project-based security

This filters on whether a job is secured through the "Project-based
Matrix Authorization Strategy".

[[ViewJobFilters-Upstream/DownstreamJobsFilter]]
== Upstream/Downstream Jobs Filter

This filter allows you to create a view consisting of jobs that are
related through the concept of Upstream/Downstream (also called "Build
after other projects are built" and "Build other projects"). +
The options provided allow you to choose exactly which types of related
jobs to show.

Note that filters are chained together, so using this filter builds off
of the jobs included by previous filters. Remember that

* This filter will not include any jobs if there are no jobs already
selected
* This filter (like most other filters) is capable of removing jobs that
were already selected

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/UpstreamDownstreamJobsFilter.png[image]#

[[ViewJobFilters-FiltertoMostRecentJobs]]
== Filter to Most Recent Jobs

Combine this filter with other filters to choose not only the exact
types of jobs to show, but how many of them to show.

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/Most-Recent-Jobs-Filter.png[image]#

[[ViewJobFilters-ShowingAllJobswiththe"AllJobs"Filter]]
== Showing All Jobs with the "All Jobs" Filter

The All Jobs view by default shows all jobs, but all other views require
you to either select the jobs you want to include, or add a regex of
".*" to select all jobs always.  This filter does this for you.  This
mostly useful if you're creating multiple "All Jobs" views, or replacing
the default view, and would like to customize the columns, and would
simply like to have each of those views show all jobs.

[[ViewJobFilters-TheBuildFilter(Wrapper)Column.]]
== The Build Filter (Wrapper) Column.

This column is an integral part of creating a smart view that shows just
the jobs you want, and just the builds for those jobs that you want.
Full documentation is found on the
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Build+Filter+%28Wrapper%29+Column[Build
Filter (Wrapper) Column] page.

[[ViewJobFilters-Roadmap]]
== Roadmap

[[ViewJobFilters-Version1.x(Ideas)]]
=== Version 1.x (Ideas)

These features are not entered as JIRA tickets because technically no
one is requesting them.  If you want one of these features, please
https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS/component/15736[Enter a
JIRA Ticket] and the feature will probably be added within a week.

* Retrofit existing filters to be default extensions (like the way
columns work).  Justifications are
** Allow for other views besides list view to more easily make use of
them (for example, the status filter wasn't picked up by other views)
** Minor benefit is that if you have hundreds of jobs, your view edit
screen is cluttered by the list of jobs when all you wanted was a regex
or a status.  So, you could delete any filters you don't want to see and
they won't show up again.  Another strategy to handle this might simply
be a checkbox titled "hide view list".  However, this would obscure the
fact that often a job is added to a view accidentally by clicking the
"new job" link while on that view.
* Update other views to use the extension.  Currently only used by
ListView.  Some views extend ListView (and do an include with jelly), so
they can't be updated unless they update to newer ListView.  Not sure
about other views - will need to take time and look at each.
* Filter on other "descriptive" things besides job name.  Large
organizations will have other things that distinguish jobs
automatically, but Job name isn't always one of those things
** Maven group id (not sure how practical this is)
** SCM - add more scms besides cvs and svn - need to test and determine
best way to make those scms "optional".
** "java package" - could do by looking at file path?
* More status filter options
** Last time built - i.e. in the last X days (very useful for managing
hundreds of jobs that should run nightly, but sometimes are
misconfigured, etc.)
** Number of days/builds stable
** Build duration (e.g. for a "long running builds" view)
* Other views filter improvements/fixes
** Proper handle of deletes
** ditto for renames
** Don't allow a view to recursively include itself (currently doesn't
break if you do, but it shouldn't even be an option)
* Filter by scheduling types
** Filter by all jobs that have polling and/or forced timed builds setup
- e.g. "Manual Jobs" and "Scheduled Jobs"
*** And/or Filter by jobs last built manually/polled/forced
** Filter by jobs that will soon be built (or SCM polled?)

** SCM "URL" (only cvs and svn)
** Job description field
* More comprehensive status filter - would obsolete some other
features/plugins, but this filter should be more useful/useable
** Stable, Unstable, Failed, Aborted
** In queue, never built, building
** Disabled
* Common include/exclude drop-down to make filters more easy to "chain"
* All Jobs
* Filter one view's jobs based on other view's jobs. 
** Exclude - For example, View 1 will want all jobs with a certain
regex, except for jobs already shown in View 2.  Then if View 2 changes
what jobs it shows, View 1 is automatically updated.
** Include - for a large organization, we might want "composite" views
(not nested views) of the hierarchical parts of the organization
