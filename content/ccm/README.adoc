 This plug-in is supported by
the https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Analysis+Collector+Plugin[Static
Analysis Collector plug-in] that collects different analysis results and
shows the results in aggregated trend graphs. Additionally, health
reporting and build stability are also based on the aggregated results.

The http://www.blunck.se/ccm.html[CCM] plug-in scans for ccm.xml files
in the build workspace and reports the number of warnings found. 

The current release is available in
the http://maven.jenkins-ci.org/content/repositories/releases/org/jvnet/hudson/plugins/ccm[download
section]. This plug-in is developed and maintained by Ullrich Hafner.
Please use
the https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Mailing+Lists[mailing
lists] or http://issues.jenkins-ci.org/[issue tracker] to ask questions,
create feature request or bug reports, since I don't read the comment
section on this page regularly.

to @amunis)

[[CCMPlugin-Release3.0.2]]
==== Release 3.0.2

. Merged pull requests to add support for "graded" complexity reports.
Some tools also describe complexity with "grades", like A, B, C, D, E
and F. The plugin will now recognize grades and assign them priorities.
The mappings are as follows: A -> low, B -> normal, C, D, E and F ->
high priority.

[[CCMPlugin-Release3.0]]
==== Release 3.0

. *Use of analysis-core API to refactor the old code and make it
compliant with standard static analysis plug-ins in Jenkins*
. *Instead of a builder plus a graph generator, now the plug-in is
simply a publisher. It means that the plug-in won't invoke CCM anymore.
You should use Windows batch commands, MSBuild or other build tools to
invoke CCM.*

generation fails because the parameters are passed to ccm.exe and
treated as source folders (thanks to Iristyle for reporting)
. Created maven site

[[CCMPlugin-Release1.1]]
==== Release 1.1

. i18n. Now CCM supports English and Brazilian Portuguese.
. Rename class CCMBuilderDescription to CCMBuilderDescriptor to keep

. Allow the user to define the output file name. (Not implemented)

and 7, however in Windows 2003 it needed double quotes added to work out
properly. (again thanks to svenborman for reporting and help testing)

[[CCMPlugin-Release1.0]]
