[[Multi-BranchProjectPlugin-Background]]
== Background

This plugin has evolved over the course of several releases, originally
depending only on the SCM API Plugin, but has since adopted other APIs
as they've become stable. The original goal was to provide a single new
project type whose configuration mimics that of a standard free-style
project. The only difference was that the SCM configuration section
utilizes the
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/SCM+API+Plugin[SCM API
Plugin] (and so the options may seem somewhat limited compared to the
usual SCM options). The project will use this SCM to automatically poll
for a list of current branches and sync all the configuration to
sub-projects. Each branch has its own sub-project. Sub-projects are just
like normal projects, except they are automatically configured by the
main (parent) project's page.

[[Multi-BranchProjectPlugin-Usage]]
==== Usage

The environment variable BRANCH_NAME can be used to obtain – you guessed
it – the branch name. It can be used in your scripts or in form fields
that support variable expansion.

Examples:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
${BRANCH_NAME}
${env.BRANCH_NAME}
----

[[Multi-BranchProjectPlugin-Gotchas]]
==== Gotchas

* Branch names get encoded (i.e. a forward slash '/' becomes '%2F'), so
some things may not work without additional configuration. The real
branch names are stored in the sub-project's display name. Make sure
both your container running Jenkins (ex: Tomcat, Glassfish, etc.) and
any HTTP server acting as a remote proxy (ex: Apache, Nginx) are
configured to support encoded slashes in the URL. The embedded Jetty
container in jenkins.war can handle this by default.
* Depending on the SCM implementation you're using, configuration
options can be limited.
* This project type should be compatible with plugins that you'd see in
normal free-style projects, but compatibility can't be guaranteed.  Feel
free to open an issue with your list of installed plugins, your
configuration, and any relevant errors or logs.
* Sub-projects appear to be configurable, but they will be overwritten
by branch indexing if you manually modify them.  There is no clear way
to remove or hide the configuration option on sub-projects (except maybe
with project-based matrix authorization??), though version 0.1.x of this
plugin accomplished that via some trickery that is not possible in newer
versions.
