== Allows users to automate their localization workflow with Zanata Localization service

https://zanata.org/[Zanata] is an open source translation management
platform.

After you install this jenkins plugin, you can set up a job to perform
typical localization workflow:

* check out your project from SCM
* push source (and/or translation) to Zanata server for translators to
work on
* pull translation from Zanata server
* commit translation into SCM (currently only git is supported
automatically. Other SCM will need to be managed yourself. e.g. via
scripting)
* push the commit to remote SCM (using git publisher or equivalent)
