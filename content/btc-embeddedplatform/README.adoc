[[BTCEmbeddedPlatform-Description]]
== Description

The Jenkins Automation Plugin for BTC EmbeddedPlatform provides easy to
use steps for Jenkins Pipeline enabling you to execute test workflow
steps from Jenkins. The BTC EmbeddedPlatform HTML reports become
available automatically on the Jenkins job page and a JUnit XML report
is generated that feeds into Jenkins test trends and status overview
dashboards.

The following workflow steps are available for Jenkins Pipeline:

* Profile Load / Create / Update
* Import of Test Cases and Stimuli Vectors
* Import / Export of Tolerances and Input Restrictions
* Execution of Functional Tests
* Automatic Vector Generation & Analysis
* Back-to-Back Test Execution
* Regression Test Execution
* Formal Verification
* Formal Test
* Configuration of Additional Coverage Goals
* Export of different reports
* BTC Migration Suite

For these workflow steps many additional settings can be configured
(optional) in order to adapt the automated test runs to your individual
project needs. In addition, two utility methods help you to connect to
instances of BTC EmbeddedPlatform and to close them if again required.
In addition, the Migration Suite use case can be addressed (see section
Migration Suite below).

default but this can still be achieved by setting its new property
"createReport" to true. +
- Added robustness for duplicate separators when using absolute paths
|2.4.1 | + |X

|2.4.10 |- Adaptions for EP 2.4.1 |2.4.1 | + | +

|2.4.1 |- Fixed a bug that caused Test Execution and Regression Test
steps to return the wrong return code. |2.4 |X | +

|2.4.0 |- Support for EmbeddedTester BASE (see parameter
"licensingPackage" in the "startup" step for more details). + |2.4 |X |X

|2.3.0 |- Added filters for scopes, folders and testcase names. For each
of the three a whitelist and blacklist can be defined as a comma
separated string. |2.4 |X |X

|2.2.0 a|
- Added a step to generate and export a model coverage report (RBT &
B2B). Requires the Simulink V&V / Simulink Coverage license.

- Test cases (so far only test cases, no SVs, ERs, etc.) that come from
a different architecture can now be imported. An automatic scope-mapping
is done using the scope name (first match). Smart mapping is only
performed if the direct import (which is based on the full scope path)
is not possible.

|2.4 |X |X

|2.1.0 |- Adaptions for EP 2.4 |2.4 |X |X

|2.0.11 |- Added the possibility to select requirement sources as the
report source for test execution reports. |2.3 | + | +

|2.0.10 |- Fixed issue: Architecture Update doesn't work if model path
changes (relative and absolute) |2.3 | + | +

|2.0.9 a|
- Added CalibrationHandling as a parameter for the TargetLin profile
creation

- Added Export of Tolerances and Input Restrictions to support
programmatic modification & re-import

|2.3 | + | +

|2.0.8 a|
- Fixed a bug that prevented combined PLL strings of default and
contributed coverage goals (e.g. Statements and Domain Coverage Goals
together in one PLL String). 

- Fixed the CSV vector import for test cases and stimuli vectors

- Fixed an issue with backslashes in absolute paths which point to a
location inside the workspace

- For Domain Coverage and Range Violation goals users can now set a
scopePath of "*" to consider all scopes. Not settings a scope path will
still default to the toplevel scope.

- Added the parameter "useCase" for the Code Analysis Report Step (RBT /
B2B)

- Removed obsolete parameter "inputRestrictions" from the Vector
Generation step. Input Restrictions can be defined through their own
step.

- Users can now select the use case for the codeAnalysisReport step (RBT
/ B2B)

- The codeAnalysisReport now exports a csv file
("BTCCoverageOverview_B2B.csv" / "BTCCoverageOverview_RBT.csv") to the
report directory which contains overall coverage percentage (Statement,
Decision and MCDC). This CSV file can be used by other Jenkins plugins
to display the coverage.

|2.3 | + | +

|2.0.7 a|
- Fixed missing parameters (reuseExistingCode, pilConfig, pilTimeout)

- Added parameters for environmentXmlPath (TL Profile Creation),
testMode (grey box / black box) and startupScriptPath

|2.3 | + | +

|2.0.3 a|
- Adapted to EP 2.3

- A Failed Profile Creation / Profile load will now always throw an
exception to break the build

- In case of failures during profile creation profile messages will be
exported and made available in Jenkins (if possible)

- Fixed a bug that prevented the use of some settings for the wrapUp
step.

- Fixed a bug that caused a specified PLL to be ignored.

- Jenkins: HPI plugin ("btc-embeddedplatform-plugin") is now available
in the official Jenkins plugin repository

|2.3 | + | +

|2.0.1 a|
- The Vector Generation step now supports dummy toplevels. If the
toplevel subsystem is a dummy scope (no C-function available) then the
vector generation will be done on the direct children of the toplevel.

- Domain Coverage and Range Violation goals can now be added to the
profile and considered during vector generation (requires additional
plugins)

- Fixed a bug that caused execution records to not be available for
debugging in the migration suite use case.

- archiveArtifacts and stash commands used by the btc-embeddedplatform
plugin are now only called if needed and were changed to be more
specific

- Fixed an issue that could cause existing profiles to be loaded in the
migration suite scenario. From now on the migrationSuite will always
create a new profile.

- Profile Creation can now be invoked explicitly.

- The Code Analysis Report can now be created explicitly. It was
formerly created by the Vector Generation step. That's still possible
but not enabled by default (controlled by property "createReport" in the
btc.vectorGeneration step).

|2.2p2 | + | +

|1.8.4 |- Fixed a bug that caused the Jenkins Use Case to checkout more
than one EmbeddedTester license. |2.2p2 | + | +

|1.8.3 a|
- Jenkins Pipeline: Wrapping BTC steps into a "dir" closure now works as
expected and relative paths are resolved according to the respective
directory.

- Fixed a bug that caused the plugin to not start if only EmbeddedTester
is installed. Dependencies (e.g. to EmbeddedValidator features) are now
only resolved when they are required (e.g. by the btc.formalVerification
step).

|2.2p2 | + | +

|1.8.1 a|
- Fixed a bug that occurred when using plugins which add additional
information to the reports.

- Added the option to set the depth of the CV engine to infinite (0).

- Adapted for EP 2.2p2 due to licensing interface changes.

|2.2p2 | + | +

|1.8.0 a|
- User Defined Coverage Goals will now only be addressed by the vector
generation if the license is available.

- Added two properties for vector generation. Users can now change the
engines (ATG, CV, ATG+CV) and set a timeout per coverage goal.

- The export of Debug Environments can now be invoked for Test
Execution, Regression Tests and Back-to-Back Tests

- A new step has been added for Formal Test Execution. This requires
existing formal specifications in your profile as a prerequisite.

|2.2p2 | + | +

|1.7.3 |- Changed default goals addressed by the vector generation to
match the changed default in the UI (all goals). |2.2-2.2p1 | + | +

|1.7.2 a|
- Errors during Test Execution are now correctly added to the Jenkins
job's console log.

- TargetLink Subsystem can now be selected. This is mandatory if more
than one toplevel TargetLink subsystem exists.

- You can now choose to disable the publishing of HTML reports, the
archiving of *.epp files and the publishing of test results if you
choose to control this on your own.

- The BTC Pipeline Steps no longer create a visible pipeline stage
because Jenkins Pipeline does provide options to handle wrapped stages.
You add still add the stages in your Jenkinsfile (see
https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/#stage).

- Adaptions of the migration suite use case which required by changes in
EP 2.2.

- PIL: Worst Case Execution Time and Maximum Stack Size are now added to
the Test Automation Report if PIL is used.

|2.1 | + | +

|1.5.1 a|
The license locations (license files, servers) can now also be defined
explicitly within the workflow step "profileLoad". If not specified
explicitly, the license locations will still be retrieved from the
registry (via FlexLM) in the way they have been configured in the EP
license dialog.

Vector Import step now correctly treats vectors as test cases in case of
kind = tc.

|2.1 | + | +

|1.5.0 a|
Added integer return values for BTC Pipeline steps to indicate the
status of each step and support more advanced handling inside the
jenkins pipeline script. The return values and their meaning are
described in the sections of each step (see section Workflow Steps).
Added a timeout property to the startup method.

Added high level Migration Suite workflow to check if two configurations
of the same model have the same structural behavior. This can also be
distributed across multiple slaves (e.g. in case of different operating
systems being involved). Additional section "Migration Suite" has been
added to the documentation.

|2.1 | + | +

|1.4.0 |Adpted for EP 2.1. Improved performance due to faster
application startup. Added Test Composer format to VectorImport step.

[[BTCEmbeddedPlatform-JenkinsPipeline]]
== Jenkins Pipeline

[[BTCEmbeddedPlatform-Overview]]
=== Overview

Integrating test runs with BTC EmbeddedPlatform in your Jenkins
workflows combines the automation and traceability concepts and results
in great benefits:

. The automated workflows scale for multiple components / projects with
low configuration effort
. You are easily able to trace changes made to your system under test
from the Source Code Management to the integrated product and recognize
test failures early in the process
. The pipeline visualization intuitively shows how much time each phase
of the testing process takes +
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .confluence-embedded-manual-size]#image:docs/images/StageView_Tracability.png[image,height=150]#
. The Jenkins Automation Plugin produces an XML report in the JUnit
format that can be analyzed by Jenkins to provide test status trends
over multiple executions and projects +
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .confluence-embedded-manual-size]#image:docs/images/JUnit-Test-Result-Trend.png[image,height=226]#
. Comprehensive HTML Reports from BTC EmbeddedPlatform are available
directly from the Jenkins job page +
 +
+
[.aui-icon .aui-icon-small .aui-iconfont-info .confluence-information-macro-icon]#
#

Jenkins' Content Security Policy can prevent the reports from being
displayed properly. See
https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Configuring+Content+Security+Policy[Configuring
Content Security Policy] for further details.
. Relevant artifacts like the test profile are accessible for easy
debugging and analysis

[[BTCEmbeddedPlatform-LicensingforJenkinsIntegration]]
=== Licensing for Jenkins Integration

In addition to the basic license requirements that depend on the chosen
workflow steps which require EmbeddedTester or EmbeddedValidator the
Jenkins Automation use case requires the "Test Automation Server"
floating network license (ET_AUTOMATION_SERVER).

Since v2.4.0 it's possible to run ET_BASE use cases (Architecture
Import, Test Case Import, Test Execution, Reporting) with an
EmbeddedTester BASE installation and the license
ET_AUTOMATION_SERVER_BASE.

[[BTCEmbeddedPlatform-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

In a Jenkins Pipeline the configuration of a job can be defined as
simple groovy code which can be versioned alongside the main source
files of the component. A full documentation of the Jenkins Pipeline can
be found *https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/[here]*. The following
example shows of how BTC EmbeddedPlatform can be automated from Jenkins
via the BTC DSL for Pipeline Plugin. The Plugin needs to be installed in
Jenkins and dedicated BTC methods to create a test automation workflow.

Executes all existing proofs in the profile and generates a Formal
Verification Report. The following optional settings are available:

[cols=",,",]
|===
|*Property* |*Description* |*Example Value(s)*

|loopUnroll a|
If the code that is to be analyzed contains loops without explicit
maximum number of iterations, e.g. a while(true) loop, these loops need
to be unrolled. The given number provides the number of iterations for
these loops that is used for the analysis. This unrolling is done in
such a way that a "fulfilled" or "fulfilled (n steps)" result can only
be obtained if this limit is not exceeded by any possible execution.
Conversely, a trace that violates this limit can be found as a witness
trace despite not strictly violating the formal requirement itself. This
is indicated in the termination reason as "Loop unroll limit (n)
exceeded".

(default: 32)

|10, 30, 50

|memoryLimit a|
Memory Limit (MB)

The maximum memory footprint to be used by the analysis tools of the
EmbeddedPlatform. If an analysis cannot be completed within these
limits, this may lead to termination reason "Memory limit (n MB)
exceeded"

(default: unlimited)

|0 (= unlimited), 1024, 3456

|timeLimit a|
Time Limit (Seconds)

The maximum duration the proof execution may take (excluding some of the
pre- and postprocessing tasks, which in general are less time intensive
than the actual model checking). This limit should be used especially
whenever the proof execution is left unattended and multiple proofs are
to be executed in batch. Otherwise, a single proof execution may consume
most of the run time and no results would be obtained for the other
proofs.

(default: unlimited)

|0 (= unlimited), 60, 1000

|searchDepth a|
Search depth (Steps)

the number of executions of the scope under test (i.e. how many
execution steps may a counter example be long). This limit corresponds
to the term "unwinding depth" employed in bounded model checking. Again,
if no such limit is provided, the search for a counter example may in
the worst case spend large amounts of time looking for longer and longer
counter examples.

(default: unlimited)

|0 (= unlimited), 10, 50

*Possible Return values*

[cols=",",]
|===
|*Return Value* |*Description*
|200 |All proofs are fulfilled (status: FULFILLED)
|300 |There was a violation (status: VIOLATED)
|301 |Unknown (status: UNKNOWN)
|400 |BTC EmbeddedValidator package is not installed
|500 |Unexpected Error

[[BTCEmbeddedPlatform-Step“wrapUp”]]
=== Step “wrapUp”

DSL Command: btc.wrapUp \{...}

*Description*

Publishes HTML reports and the JUnit XML report to Jenkins and closes
BTC EmbeddedPlatform. The following optional settings are available:

[width="100%",cols="34%,33%,33%",]
|===
|*Property* |*Description* |*Example Value(s)*

|archiveProfiles a|
Boolean flag controlling whether BTC EmbeddedPlatform profiles are
archived by Jenkins to be available on the Job Page. You can disable
this and control the "archiveArtifacts" option yourself.

(default: true)

|true, false

|publishReports a|
Boolean flag controlling whether the BTC EmbeddedPlatform reports are
published in Jenkins to be available on the Job Page. You can disable
this and control the "publishHTML" option yourself.

(default: true)

|true, false

|publishResults a|
Boolean flag controlling whether BTC EmbeddedPlatform test results
(JUnit XML) are published in Jenkins to be available on the Job Page and
for further aggregations. You can disable this and control the "junit"
option yourself.

(default: true)

|true, false

[[BTCEmbeddedPlatform-BTCMigrationSuite]]
== BTC Migration Suite

The BTC Migration Suite allows you to perform a fully automatic
regression test between different Matlab or TargetLink versions. This
makes it easy to document that the change of a tool version in a
particular project does not influence the behavior of software
components on model and code level.

[[BTCEmbeddedPlatform-Step“migrationSource”]]
=== Step “migrationSource”

DSL Command: btc.migrationSource \{...}

*Description*

Creates a profile on the source configuration (e.g. old Matlab /
TargetLink version), generates vectors for full coverage and exports the
simulation results.

[[BTCEmbeddedPlatform-Step“migrationTarget”]]
=== Step “migrationTarget”

DSL Command: btc.migrationTarget \{...}

*Description*

Creates a profile on the target configuration (e.g. newMatlab /
TargetLink version), imports the simulation results from the source
config and runs a regression test.

 +

For both steps (migrationSource and migrationTarget) the following
parameters are mandatory:

[cols=",,",]
|===
|*Property* |*Description* |*Example Value(s)*

|*tlModelPath* |Path of the TargetLink model. The path can be absolute
or relative to the jenkins job's workspace. |"tlModel.slx", "model.mdl"

|*matlabVersion* a|
Controls which matlab version will be used by the tool.

String containing the release version (e.g. “2016b”), optionally
followed by “32-bit” or “64-bit”. The version and 32/64-bit part should
be separated by a space character.

a|
“2010a 32-bit”

“2016b”

|===

In Addition, you can add all other the parameters from the
steps btc.profileLoad and btc.vectorGeneration if required.

[[BTCEmbeddedPlatform-MigrationSuiteExample:Jenkinsfile]]
=== Migration Suite Example: Jenkinsfile

The following example shows a Jenkinsfile for a complete migration of a
TargetLink model. The labels that are specified for the node describe
the resource requirements for each configuration and allow Jenkins to
provide a suitable agent. Any data produced by the migrationSource step
which is needed by the migrationTarget step will be automatically
handled by Jenkins. This way, the agent for the target config (which is
obviously a different one machine due to the different Windows versions)
will have access to the simulation results from the source config
required for the regression test.

[[BTCEmbeddedPlatform-AddingtheBTCPlugintoJenkins]]
== Adding the BTC Plugin to Jenkins

In order to use the convenient pipeline syntax described above you need
to add the BTC Plugin to Jenkins. This is very easy and can be done with
the following steps:

On your Jenkins web UI go to Jenkins > Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins

Click on the Available tab and search for btc-embeddedplatform

Select the plugin btc-embeddedplatform and install it

. Once the plugin is installed new versions which are available will
appear in the Updates section
. Updating a plugin usually requires you to restart your Jenkins master

The BTC Pipeline plugin is now available in Jenkins and you can benefit
from the convenient BTC pipeline methods described in the sections
above. Enjoy!

If your Jenkins master can't access the internet you can manually
download the plugin
https://updates.jenkins-ci.org/latest/btc-embeddedplatform.hpi[here] and
upload it to the server via the advanced section of the "Manage Plugins"
page.
