[.conf-macro .output-inline]#This plugin converts
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182486.aspx[MSTest] TRX test
reports into JUnit XML reports so it can be integrated with Jenkin's
JUnit features. This plugin converts the .coveragexml files found in the
project workspace to the EMMA format.#

You can use
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/MSTestRunner+Plugin[MSTestRunner
plugin] or
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/VsTestRunner+Plugin[VsTestRunner
plugin] to run the test and use this plugin to process the results.

 

The MSTest plugin analyzes the test execution reports (TRX) files
generated by mstest and vstest.console. These files include a test
execution summary, and detailed data about what happened during the
tests execution. Along with the test execution records, vstest or mstest
may also include a link towards the code coverage data collected during
the tests execution. These coverage files have a binary, proprietary
format, and you have to convert them to XML before that the MSTest
publisher is invoked.

This plugin converts the test records to the JUnit format, and adds them
to the build report. The plugin also searches for the link to the code
coverage data. If it is present, and it contains valuable data, the
plugin converts it to the Emma format by means of an ad-hoc XSL
transformation.

If you want to show the coverage data on the build report, it is up to
you to add the Emma plugin to your Jenkins instance, and to add the
corresponding post-build action to your build. The coverage reports will
be somewhere in the build workspace, and their name will match the
pattern: `emma\coverage.xml`. Apart from the Emma plugin, which is
rather outdated, probably also other plugins can complete the same task
(for example, the JaCoCo plugin).

[[MSTestPlugin-PipelineSupport]]
== Pipeline Support

The MSTest plugin supports the pipeline plugin (and/or Jenkinsfile build
definitions). The plugin call be called with an instruction like

....
step([$class: 'MSTestPublisher', testResultsFile:"**/*.trx", failOnError: true, keepLongStdio: true])
....

Or with its shortest alternative:

....
mstest testResultsFile:"**/*.trx", keepLongStdio: true
....

 

[[MSTestPlugin-CodeCoverageSupport]]
== Code Coverage Support

Since the code coverage data has a binary, proprietary format, and that
the tools capable of handling them are released under a proprietary
license along with the develipment environments, you will have to
perform the data conversion yourself. Here's how.

[[MSTestPlugin-CodeCoverageDataConversion]]
=== Code Coverage Data Conversion

To convert the binary VSTest.Console output to the
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.visualstudio.coverage.analysis.coverageds.aspx[Microsoft
CoverageDS XML format], you may use one of the prebuilt applications
referenced in the V0.14 release notes below, or you can build the
following converter application:

*CoverageCoverter.exe*

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
    class Program
    {
        static int Main(string[] args)
        {
            if ( args.Length != 2)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Coverage Convert - reads VStest binary code coverage data, and outputs it in XML format.");
                Console.WriteLine("Usage:  ConverageConvert <sourcefile> <destinationfile>");
                return 1;
            }

            CoverageInfo info;
            string path;
            try
            {
                path = System.IO.Path.GetDirectoryName(args[0]);
                info = CoverageInfo.CreateFromFile(args[0], new string[] { path }, new string[] { });
            }
            catch (Exception e)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Error opening coverage data: {0}",e.Message);
                return 1;
            }

            CoverageDS data = info.BuildDataSet();

            try
            {
                data.WriteXml(args[1]);
            }
            catch (Exception e)
            {

                Console.WriteLine("Error writing to output file: {0}", e.Message);
                return 1;
            }

            return 0;
        }
    }

The CoverageDS and CoverageInfo types are being exposed by the
Microsoft.VisualStudio.Coverage.Analysis.dll (official
documentation: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.visualstudio.coverage.analysis.coverageds.aspx,
article explaining how to use these assemblies with a nice step-by-step:
https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/phuene/2009/12/01/programmatic-coverage-analysis-in-visual-studio-2010/) 

The following Powershell build step will find one binary coverage data
file in your workspace and convert it to XML format, assuming you use
the default TestResults directory. (Modify as necessary to handle
multiple coverage files)

*Powershell build step for CoverageDS XML Conversion*

*Can I use Microsoft's CodeCoverage.exe for data conversion?*

Microsoft supplies _C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio
1X.0\Team Tools\Dynamic Code Coverage Tools\CodeCoverage.exe_ with
Visual Studio. But unfortunately this tool uses an XML format distinct
from the CoverageDS format used by vstest and mstest, and is not
compatible with the MSTest plugin. If you are interested in this topic,
and you've some experience with XSL, there are a couple of transforms to
convert back and forth in the

* The release description is available on
github: https://github.com/jenkinsci/mstest-plugin/releases/tag/mstest-0.20

[[MSTestPlugin-Version0.19(September1st,2015)]]
=== Version 0.19 (September 1st, 2015)

* Support for web tests (contacted by email, by Peter Barnes. No Jira
issue has been opened)
* Let the users still using Java 1.6 to continue using the plugin
https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-29032[[JENKINS-29032]]
* Mark the inconclusive tests as 'skipped'
https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-29316[[JENKINS-29316]]

[[MSTestPlugin-Version0.18(May12th,2015)---!!!Java1.7isrequired!!!]]
=== Version 0.18 (May 12th, 2015) --- !!! Java 1.7 is required !!!

* Add support for "Retain long standard output/error"
https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-28281[[JENKINS-28281]]. The
default value for this option is false. If you're automating the
creation of your jobs, simply specify keepLongStdio=on as a parameter of
your query. Any other value than 'on' will set this option to false.
* Add localized messages for it, pt-BR, fr
* Cumulated code coverage filename: vstest.coveragexml
* Add default values for test result pattern and "fail if no result file
is found": **/*.trx and true.

[[MSTestPlugin-Version0.17(May4th,2015)---!!!Java1.7isrequired!!!]]
=== Version 0.17 (May 4th, 2015) --- !!! Java 1.7 is required !!!

* Add a checkbox to ignore missing TRX files (Thanks Christopher Bush,
pull request https://github.com/jenkinsci/mstest-plugin/pull/7[#7]). The
pull request contains also a way to automate job creation using the REST
API. So, if you're automating the creation of your jobs, just specify
failOnError=on to enable this feature. Any other value than 'on' will
set this option to false.
* Fix the code coverage calculations (Thanks junshanxu, pull request
https://github.com/jenkinsci/mstest-plugin/pull/6[#6]): a sum over all
the nodes is better than using the value of the first node only.

[[MSTestPlugin-Version0.16(Apr14th,2015)---!!!Java1.7isrequired!!!]]
=== Version 0.16 (Apr 14th, 2015) --- !!! Java 1.7 is required !!!

* Show the code coverage graph for coveragexml files (one of the two
XSD, the one produced by vstest)

[[MSTestPlugin-Version0.15(Apr14th,2015)---!!!Java1.7isrequired!!!]]
=== Version 0.15 (Apr 14th, 2015) --- !!! Java 1.7 is required !!!

* Improve support for data driven tests (Thanks, Darryl Melander: pull
request https://github.com/jenkinsci/mstest-plugin/pull/5[#6])
* Preserve charsets while fixing TRX files (JENKINS-23531, reopened by
JitinJohn@MS)

[[MSTestPlugin-Version0.14(Apr1st,2015)]]
=== Version 0.14 (Apr 1st, 2015)

* Support for output/stdout messages (JENKINS-19384)
* Drop invalid XML entities (JENKINS-23531). MSTest allows writing XML
entities corresponding to invalid XML characters. These XML entities
generate exceptions while being parsed by Java parsers. For me, it's
still unclear if such entities are standard or not. However, to avoid
these exceptions, the mstest parser simply drops them. These entities
normally correspond to non printable characters.
* Support for .coveragexml files. The coverage data present in these
files is being transformed in an EMMA coverage report. Today, you can
try to generate vscoveragexml files using
https://github.com/gredman/CI.MSBuild.Tasks or
https://github.com/yasu-s/CoverageConverter.

[[MSTestPlugin-Version0.13(Mar18,2015)]]

* Support for data driven tests (JENKINS-8193, JENKINS-4075)
* Support for timed out tests (JENKINS-11332)
* Support for TextMessages (JENKINS-17506)
* Improved processing for tests whose @outcome is not set
* Stacktraces are now shown as stacktraces, and error messages as error
