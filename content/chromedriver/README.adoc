[.conf-macro .output-inline]##This plugin auto-installs
http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver[ChromeDriver] to
every slave.##This is useful if you run Selenium tests on your Jenkins
by using Google Chrome, which requires this separate platform-specific
binary to be downloaded and available.

This plugin does not have any configuration. It will automatically kick
in when a slave becomes online.
