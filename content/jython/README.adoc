Adds the ability to execute Jython script. What makes this plugin
special, as opposed to the
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Python+Plugin[Python Plugin]
is that it ships with the Jython runtime, instead of actually requiring
Python to be installed on the machine.

_Note that as of version 1.4, the Jython script no longer executes
within the Jenkins JVM process, but forks its own JVM. This is more
consistent with how other plug-ins work, and ensures that in distributed
deployments, the Jython script will execute in the node that a build is
running on (instead of always running on the master)._

[[JythonPlugin-Changelog]]
== Changelog

[[JythonPlugin-Version1.9(Dec182011)]]
=== Version 1.9 (Dec 18 2011)

* Set up the Jython build step environment so that a Jenkins HTTP proxy,
if it's defined, will be used by urllib and urllib2. More specifically,
it defines the "http_proxy" environment variable for the build step. To
override this, define your own "http_proxy" environment variable (either
at the global/slave/job level).

[[JythonPlugin-Version1.8(Dec162011)]]
=== Version 1.8 (Dec 16 2011)

[[JythonPlugin-Version1.7(Jul202011)]]

key behavior.
