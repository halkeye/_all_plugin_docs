Authenticate user in Jenkins based on kerberos ticket negotiation.

[[KerberosSSOPlugin-Summary]]
== Summary

This plugin reads user's Kerberos ticket and uses it to log the user
into Jenkins. It is designed to work really well with the Active
Directory plugin. It can also redirect users that omit specifying a
domain in their request.

The authentication can be bypassed for specific request by setting a
Bypass-Kerberos header in the request. It doesn't matter which value it
has, the user will be authenticated as anonymous.

Plugin can be configured to permit unauthenticated requests and
authenticated only if requested. Otherwise, authentication is performed
for every request.

[[KerberosSSOPlugin-Prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

* In order to use the plugin, you need a Kerberos environment. If you
do, locating the files the plugin needs is the most time consuming task.
* The files mentioned below needs to be readable by Jenkins
* A user database. The plugin will not log in a user if it's not found
in a database. This is where the AD plugin comes in.

[[KerberosSSOPlugin-Userguide]]
== User guide

The configuration page for Kerberos Single Sign-on plugin is found under
the global configuration page instead of under Security.

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/kerberos-sso-config.png[image]#

The logout button is still visible for practical reasons. It refreshes
the session and authentication when the user presses it, but the user
won't notice the effect since he's immediately logged in again.

[[KerberosSSOPlugin-Setupguide]]
== Setup guide

Since this plugin took us so long to set up correctly, we'll provide a
short list of steps and hints on how this setup can be done. Some of
these tips can also be found in the help links in the configuration
page. This guide is for a server using *Linux*. We have not successfully
configured the plugin to run on a Windows server. Please inform us if
you succeed in doing so, or just add the steps here on the wiki.

* *The service account* is only used when a keytab is not present on the
server. Keytabs are probably used either everywhere or nowhere on the
intranet. Although, if there are Service accounts at hand, it can only
benefit the stability of the solution to provide it. Some Kerberos
information sources, such as Spnego may call the service account
"pre-auth username and password"

* *Location of krb5.conf* defaults to "/etc/krb5.conf". Also, if the
user enters other information in that field, and the file is not found
at that location, it will head back to "/etc/krb5.conf" to look for the
file. If you have a Kerberos environment, probably all users have this
file. The _libdefaults_ section tells Spnego which encryption types are
used in the realm and _realms_ tells Spnego where the Key Distribution
Center is located. The requests to authenticate provided Kerberos
tickets are sent to that server. it is *very important* that Jenkins has
read permissions to this file! +
The following is a complete file where sensitive data have been
replaced:
+
[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
[libdefaults]
  default_realm = INTERNALDOMAIN.NET
  default_tgs_enctypes = RC4-HMAC DES-CBC-CRC DES-CBC-MD5
  default_tkt_enctypes = RC4-HMAC DES-CBC-CRC DES-CBC-MD5
  preferred_enctypes = RC4-HMAC DES-CBC-CRC DES-CBC-MD5

[realms]
  INTERNALDOMAIN.NET = {
    kdc = 59.169.100.36
    kdc = 7b99:a413:0:ac1b::00:01
    kdc = 7b99:a413:0:ac1b::00:02
    kdc = 7b99:a413:0:ac1b::00:03
  }
----

* *Location of Login.conf* is the most important part of the setup and
by far the most complex. If this is wrongly specified, Jenkins will tell
you immediately with a Servlet Exception. It has to point to a file on
the server named "login.conf" or, commonly in documentation etc,
"jaas.conf". As with the "krb5.conf" file, it's *very important* that
Jenkins has read permissions to this file! +
The following is a complete file where sensitive data have been
replaced:
+
[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
Kerberos {
  com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required
  principal="HTTP/hostname01@INTERNALDOMAIN.NET"
  doNotPrompt="false"
  useTicketCache="false"
  useKeyTab="true"
  keyTab="/etc/krb5.keytab";
};

spnego-client {
  com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required;
};

spnego-server {
  com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required
  isInitiator="false"
  useKeyTab="true"
  keyTab="/etc/krb5.keytab"
  principal="HTTP/hostname01@INTERNALDOMAIN.NET"
  tryFirstPass="true"
  storePass="true"
  storeKey="true";
};

com.sun.security.jgss.initiate {
  com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required
  principal="HTTP/hostname01@INTERNALDOMAIN.NET"
  useKeyTab="true"
  keyTab="/etc/krb5.keytab";
};

com.sun.security.jgss.accept {
  com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required
  principal="HTTP/hostname01@INTERNALDOMAIN.NET"
  useKeyTab="true"
  keyTab="/etc/krb5.keytab";
};
----

This file will be subject to a lot of internal settings. The
Krb5LoginModule is listed in every section and what it means is
basically that the login module is required for each of the entries and
a list of parameters follows. The important parameters we have found
are: useKeyTab="true", or pre-auth details will be required. A link to
where a keytab is stored is also needed through the keyTab parameter.
It's *very important* that Jenkins has read permissions to the keytab
file! +
When setting up the server, it may be required to modify this keytab
file on the server:
+
[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
# Write the following into a terminal:

sudo net ads keytab list

# If the server is correctly set up, it the keytab will contain rows looking something like this: HTTP/HOSTNAME01@INTERNALDOMAIN.NET

# The important part here is the HTTP principal. If it doesn't contain such a row, type the following:

sudo net ads keytab add \-P HTTP

# Verify with the list command that the keytab now contains HTTP entries.
----
+
Another important parameter is the isInitiator="false" parameter to
spnego-server. In this context, the client initiates the authorization
by requesting a web page. +
We have left the parameter list for the client empty. This is because
Keytabs are spcifically server side solutions and the principal is the
client itself. +
The parameters left to experiment with is storeKey, storePass,
tryFirstPass, doNotPrompt and useTicketCache. They may or may not make
any difference.

* The checkbox configuration does not need any further explanation than
given in the help links.

* An important thing to notice is that your servlet container, for
example Tomcat, needs to have a sufficient header size. This varies
between environments and is not always easy to spot as the problem when
something seems wrong.

*Good luck!*
