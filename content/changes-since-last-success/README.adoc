This plugin adds a build action to aggregate changes from all previous
builds to the last successful one. The primary goal is to generate a
changelog to be used for continuous delivery, as an aggregate for all
changes since the last deployable artifact. 

Additionally, this plugin can be used to generate a changelog for an
arbitrary range of builds :

* /changes-since-last-success/lastSuccess for the last successful build
* /changes-since-last-success/lastStable for the last stable build
* /changes-since-last-success/buildNumber/1234 for changes since build
1234
* /changes-since-last-success/since/date for changes since specified
date (using yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'Z')
