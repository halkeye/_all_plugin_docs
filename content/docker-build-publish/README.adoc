This https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker-build-publish-plugin[plugin]
provides the ability to build projects with a Dockerfile, and publish
the resultant tagged image (repo) to the docker registry. 
https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker-build-publish-plugin/blob/master/README.md[Docs
are here].

If you want to build and push your Docker based project to the docker
registry (including private repos), then you are in luck!

This is an early version - build @michaelneale of @cloudbees  - ask me
if you have questions.

[[CloudBeesDockerBuildandPublishplugin-Features:]]
== Features:

* Only a Dockerfile needed to build your project
* Publish to docker index/registry - INCLUDING PRIVATE REPOS/IMAGES
* nocache option (for rebuild of all Dockerfile steps)
* publish option
* manage registry credentials for private and public repos
* tag the image built - use any Jenkins env. variables.

== Dockerfile as buildfile

A Dockerfile is a convenient way to express build instructions. This
plugin will use the Dockerfile in the workspace (possibly previously
checked out from git) and will invoke docker build to create the Docker
image. The result can be automatically uploaded to the Docker Registry
or a private registry.

As the Beatles song, all you need is Dockerfile, and love. If you have a
Dockerfile in the root of your project, then no further configuration is
needed.

**_Warning_**__: the instructions below seem to cover the 0.x version of
the plugin. Current documentation is__
_https://go.cloudbees.com/docs/cloudbees-documentation/cje-user-guide/chapter-docker-build-publish.html[here]._

Firstly, ensure you have docker running (if you are running with a
slave, ensure the slave can run docker) - and that Jenkins can run
docker commands.

Setup a build of any type - with a CloudBees Docker Build and Publish
build step. You can use the example under src/test/example to build a
very simple busybox based image, and push it to
jenkinsci/docker-build-and-publish-example. +
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkinsci/docker-build-publish-plugin/master/build-config.png[image]#

The usual Docker build caching mechanism applies - and you can choose to
publish, or not, the resultant image, configured under Advanced options.

Builds will be decorated with the repository name (and tag) of the build
images: +
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkinsci/docker-build-publish-plugin/master/build-label.png[image]#

You can supply multiple tags for an image separated by commas. The
latest tag is automatically applied to image - if you do not want this
check the Do not tag this build as latest checkbox.

[[CloudBeesDockerBuildandPublishplugin-WhyuseaDockerfile]]
== Why use a Dockerfile

Defining your build as a Dockerfile means that it will run in a
consistent linux environment, no matter where the build is run. You also
end up with an image (in a repository, possibly pushed to a registry)
that can then be deployed - the exact same image you built.

Dockerfiles can also help speed up builds. If there has been no change
relative to a build instruction in the Dockerfile - then a cached
version of that portion of the build can be used (this is a fundamental
feature of docker)
