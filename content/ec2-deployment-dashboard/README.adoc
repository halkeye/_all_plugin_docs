This plugin was developed to help managing the deployment of software
artifacts to different environments easily. You configure an artifact
repository (like Artifactory or Nexus) and your Amazon EC2 deployment
servers. The plugin manages the deployed versions of any artifact from
your repository to your server environments (i.e. DEV, TEST, PROD). The
plugin works with Amazon EC2 instances.

[[EC2DeploymentDashboardPlugin-DashboardView]]
==== Dashboard View

This Jenkins dashboard gives you an overview of all your EC2 instances
that you configured. It displays the current state, the deployed
artifact version, uptime, instance type and the current IP. It also gets
all artifact versions from your artifact repository. Currently we
support jFrog Artifactory and Sonatype Nexus.
