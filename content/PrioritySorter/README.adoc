[[PrioritySorterPlugin-Description]]
== _Description_

This plugin adds the ability to assign different priorities to jobs: the
lower the priority a job has, the sooner the job will run.

This can be very helpful, when one wants to add low priority jobs, but
wants to have higher-priority jobs run first. This is especially true
when hardware is limited, or when there are different groups of jobs
that should share resources (equally).

[[PrioritySorterPlugin-Fundamentals]]
=== _Fundamentals_

The plugin is build around some basic concepts:

* Queue Strategy
* Job Group
* Job Inclusion Strategy, and
* Priority Strategy.

First, the _Queue Strategy_ describes how the priority of a job is
interpreted. It will translate the job's assigned priority to a
corresponding weight in the queue. The queue is, then, sorted based on
the assigned weight.

With the _Priority_ Sorter, you will need to group your jobs into _Job
Groups_. A _Job Group_'s _Job Inclusion_ Strategy devides whether a
specific job should be included in the group.

The priority of the job is then set by the _Priority Strategy_, and each
_Job Group_ can have any number priority strategies.

When a new job is queued, the following will happen:

* The _Priority Sorter_ will go though the configured _Job Groups_ from
top to bottom. +
** When it finds a Job Group where the job is to be included, it will
look though the _Priority Strategies_ from top to bottom
*** When it finds a _Priority Strategy_ that matches its criteria, it
will use this strategy to assign a priority the the Job.
* The _Priority Sorter_ will then consult the _Queue Strategy_ to
translate the priority to a weight, i.e. a position in the queue.

[[PrioritySorterPlugin-QueueStrategies]]
=== _Queue Strategies_

There are three included Queue Strategies, each of which will sort the
Queue differently.

[[PrioritySorterPlugin-Absolute]]
==== Absolute

Each job will be assigned a priority, and, the lower the priority, the
sooner the job will be run.

[[PrioritySorterPlugin-FairQueuing]]
==== Fair Queuing

Each Job will be assigned a priority, but the queue will try to share
the resources equally over different priorities in a round-robin
fashion.

[[PrioritySorterPlugin-WeightedFairQueuing]]
==== Weighted Fair Queuing

The same as _Fair Queuing_, but jobs with a lower priority will be run
more frequently those with higher a priority. Remember, that the lower
the priority assignment, the higher the importance.

[[PrioritySorterPlugin-JobInclusionStrategies]]
=== _Job Inclusion Strategies_

This setting describes which jobs are included in a Job Group, and is
relatively self explanatory. It is worth mentioning the "Jobs Marked for
Inclusion" setting. When this is selected, you are requested to enter a
name of the _Job Group_. This name will then be an available option on
each job, providing an alternative "bottom-up" way to group jobs, rather
than the default "top-down" approach of the other strategies.

[[PrioritySorterPlugin-PriorityStrategies]]
=== _Priority Strategies_

It is possible to assign the priority, based on different _Priority
Strategies._

This setting describes what priority a job should have, and is self
explanatory. It is worth mentioning the the "Take the Priority from
Property on the Job" setting. When selected, a drop-down - where you can
select a priority - appears on all projects that would generate jobs to
be included in this group.

[[PrioritySorterPlugin-MainConfiguration]]
== _Main Configuration_

The plugin's main configuration options are available on the Jenkins
configuration page. Configuration options for _Priority Strategy_ are
available on its own page, accessible from the root actions menu.

On the main configuration page, you can select the number of priorities
you would like to use, as well as a default priority to use where no
other priority could be assigned.

image:docs/images/warning.svg[(warning)]
* Please note that lower number means higher priority! See details on
the screen, for the specifics on each strategy. *

[[PrioritySorterPlugin-AssigningPriorities]]
== _Assigning Priorities_

On the main menu, you will find the link to a page where you can assign
priorities to each Job

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/JobPriorities.png[image]#

On this page you will be able to assign jobs to groups, and priorities
to jobs.

_image:docs/images/warning.svg[(warning)]_
* Please note that all matching is done top to bottom by first match*

You can limit access to this functionality to administrators, by
checking the appropriate check-box on the main configuration page.

[[PrioritySorterPlugin-RunExclusive]]
=== _Run Exclusive_

If a job from a _Run Exclusive_ job group gets started, jobs from other
groups will remain blocked, and will not get executed until all jobs
from the _Run Exclusive_ job group are complete, [.underline]#regardless
of priority#.

[[PrioritySorterPlugin-UsingtheViewColumn]]
=== _Using the View Column_

Since a job can get a different priority each time it is started, the
view column cannot show the "correct" priority for the Job.

The column will show the priority used the last time the job was
launched, and, if the job has not been started yet, the column will show
_Pending._

[[PrioritySorterPlugin-Notablechangesandupgrading]]
=== _Notable changes and upgrading_

[[PrioritySorterPlugin-Upgradingfrom1.x]]
==== _Upgrading from 1.x_

Version *2.x* is a complete rewrite of the plugin, but still supports
running in version *1.x* compatibility mode. However if you are
satisfied with the functionality of *1.x*, there is little point in
upgrading. +
Upgrading from version *1.x* to version *3.x* will remove all *1.x*
configurations. Therefore, if you need to keep configured values,
upgrade to *2.x*, first, switch to _Advanced Mode_, and then upgrade
from *2.x* to *3.x*.

[[PrioritySorterPlugin-Upgradingfrom2.x]]
==== _Upgrading from 2.x_

In version *3.x*, the option "Allow priorities directly on Jobs" has
been removed in favor of the Priority Strategy "Take the priority from
Property on the Job" (see above). Legacy Mode is removed (see above
regarding upgrading from version *1.x*).

[[PrioritySorterPlugin-Troubleshooting]]
== _Troubleshooting_

To get some inside information on how, and why, a certain job gets a
certain priority, you can turn on some extra logging.

* Logger: *_PrioritySorter.Queue.Items_*
** To get more info on the assigned priorities, and state transition of
the items in the queue, set the log level to *_FINE_.*
** To get more info on how the jobs are matched to job groups, and rules
to get the priority, set the log level to *_FINER_.*

To get logging on when the _Queue Sorter_ is active log, use:

* Logger: **_PrioritySorter.Queue.Sorter_**__,__ with the level set to
*_FINE_*.
** To see all items sorted (the queue) by the Queue Sorter, set the log
level to *_FINER_.*
