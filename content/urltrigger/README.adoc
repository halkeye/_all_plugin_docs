Older versions of this plugin may not be safe to use. Please review the
following warnings before using an older version:

* https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2018-06-25/#SECURITY-819[Server-side
request forgery vulnerability]

URLTrigger plug-in makes it possible to monitor changes of the response
got from an URL invocation.

[[URLTriggerPlugin-Features]]
== Features

Jenkins can be configured to poll URL changes. +
The plug-in makes it possible to check the last modification date
response and the response content of an URL invocation. +
For the response content, you can check:

* a simple response content (the content nature is not interpreted; a
MD5 is used)
* a TXT response content (the returned values from the evaluation of
regular expressions are checked)
* an XML response content (the returned values from the evaluation of
XPath expressions are checked)
* a JSON response content (the returned values from the evaluation of
JSONPath expressions are checked)

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/urltrigger.png[image]#

Note: The plug-in uses only persistence in memory. There is no impact on
the Jenkins infrastructure (no new files created). +
This plugin provides a polling typology among the
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/XTrigger+Plugin[XTrigger
Plugin].

[[URLTriggerPlugin-SomeUsecases]]
== Some Use cases

* This plugin enables users to check if new artifacts (such as binaries)
have been deployed in a repository (managed for example by a repository
manager such as Sonatype Nexus, JFrog Artifactory, Apache Archiva and so
on). +
* This plugin is useful to know if a stage of a pipeline (for a
continuous testing, a continous delivery or a continuous deployment) has
to be executed.

[[URLTriggerPlugin-KnownLimitations]]
== Known Limitations

Only http(s) and ftp URLs are supported. For non-http protocols,
consider other XTrigger plugins such as the

Plugin]
