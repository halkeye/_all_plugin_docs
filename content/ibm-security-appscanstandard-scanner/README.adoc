[[IBMSecurityAppScanStandardScannerPlugin-ProjectDescription]]
== Project Description

The purpose of this plugin is to allow Jenkins to perform dynamic
analysis with IBM AppScan Standard with minimal configuration.

AppScan Standard is a security tool provided by IBM that will scan
application for vulnerabilities in run-time.

IBM Security AppScan Standard supports:

* *Broad coverage* to scan and test for a wide range of application
security vulnerabilities.
* *Accurate scanning and advanced testing* that delivers high levels of
accuracy.
* *Quick remediation* with prioritized results and fix recommendations.
* *Enhanced insight and compliance* that helps manage compliance and
provides awareness of key issues.

Configuring AppScan Standard to perform automated scanning with custom
batch jobs or shell scripts can be a time-consuming and error-prone
process.

This Jenkins plugin greatly simplifies the process of automating AppScan
Standard by providing global settings and simple scan configuration
within Jenkins.

== Using the plugin

. Create a new job or access an existing job
. Select *Configure*

.  
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/buildstep.png[image]#

on the global configuration screen.
.. {blank}
...  If you have not added an installation, please go the the Jenkins
Global Tool Configuration link under Manage Jenkins.
...  If you only have one installation configured, the installation
should be selected for you. If you plan to execute AppScan Standard on
multiple Jenkins nodes, you may need to configure multiple installation
paths.
.. *Starting URL* is the URL AppScan Standard will use to run the
spiders on to find compile a list of URIs to scan.
.. *Authenticated Scan* will scan the website logged in as the provided
account, this will provide better scanning results.
... *Recorded Login Sequence* uses a recorded login sequence (you must
generate it using AppScan Standard previously) to login.

[[IBMSecurityAppScanStandardScannerPlugin-UsingNodestorunAppScanStandardPlugin]]
== Using Nodes to run AppScan Standard Plugin

If you have AppScan Standard installed on a node you must configure the
build to run on that node so that the plugin can reach the installation.

First you must set that machine as a node (slave), you can follow
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Step+by+step+guide+to+set+up+master+and+agent+machines+on+Windows[this
guide to do so].

Afterwards you can use the
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/NodeLabel+Parameter+Plugin[Node
and Label Parameter Plugin], following the guide provided in its wiki
achieving this goal should be straightforward.

Setting a parameter on the build would look something like the image
below.

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/parameter.png[image]#

[[IBMSecurityAppScanStandardScannerPlugin-UsingHTMLPublisherPluginwithAppScanStandardPlugin]]
== Using HTML Publisher Plugin with AppScan Standard Plugin

To take full advantage of this plugin, you may want to combine it with
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/HTML+Publisher+Plugin[HTML
Publisher Plugin]

If you already have HTML Publisher installed, this can be achieved in 2
simple steps:

. Select *Generate a Report*, insert a *Report Title* and check *HTML
Report*
.. [.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/generateReport.png[image]#
. In the *Post-build Actions* add *Publish HTML reports*, press *Add*
and fill it in to match the settings from AppScan Standard Plugin
(*report title must match Index page[s]*)
.. [.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/publishHTML.png[image]#

When the build completes you will have a new item in the job's page,
press it to access the report generated by AppScan Standard.

{empty}[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/htmlreport.png[image]# +
The expected result should be similar to the image below *if you allow
CSS in Jenkins*, if you only see text then CSS is most likely blocked
(set by default),
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35783964/jenkins-html-publisher-plugin-no-css-is-displayed-when-report-is-viewed-in-j[this
link explains how to change that option.]

If you change the CSS options, they won't be applied to the current
report, you must re-run the build/scan.

[[IBMSecurityAppScanStandardScannerPlugin-RunningAppScanStandardinaPipeline]]
== Running AppScan Standard in a Pipeline

. Navigate to "Pipeline Syntax" (follow a, b or c below) +
.. (create a pipeline job, save and it will be on the left side menu)
.. (navigate to an existing pipeline job, it will be on the left side
menu)
.. (navigate to
http://localhost:8080/pipeline-syntax/[http://JENKINS-URL-HERE/pipeline-syntax/)]
. In "Steps" find "step: General Build Step"
. in "Build Step" find "Run AppScan Standard"
. Configure AppScan Standard plugin as usual
. Press "Generate Pipeline Script" and copy the resulting script
. Paste the script in your pipeline inside a node

The end result would look like the image below.

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .confluence-embedded-manual-size]#image:docs/images/image2017-7-21_16:51:44.png[image,width=957,height=819]#

A resulting script looks something like the one below, you can use this
one as your starting point.
