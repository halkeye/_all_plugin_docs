== How to Use

'''''

[[ProtecodeSCPlugin-Gettingstarted]]
=== Getting started

. Install the Protecode SC Jenkins plugin via the *Plugin Manager* and
restart Jenkins.
. Configure system wide Protecode SC server address.
* Manage Jenkins > Configure System
** *Protecode SC: Server address*
*** Specify the HTTP address of the Protecode SC installation here, such
as https://protecode-sc.mydomain.com/.
** *Protecode SC: Disable certificate validation*
*** Allow connections to Protecode SC server without certificate
validation. It is not recommended to use this option. Instead you should
consider getting a valid certificate for your server.

[[ProtecodeSCPlugin-Freestylebuildconfiguration]]
=== [.anchor]#Freestyle build configuration#

Configure a build step as follows:

. *Protecode SC*
* _Credentials_
** (new) Add
*** Select "Global" and "Username with password"
*** Enter your user Protecode SC user details
** (existing) Select suitable credentials
* _Group ID_
** Specify the Protecode SC *Group ID* where the artifacts should be
uploaded to. The group id is only the number of the group. +
Group ID can be found from the Protecode SC service by looking at the
URL when browsing an individual group:
https://protecode-sc.mydomain.com/group/1234/ +
or with **Groups API**https://protecode-sc.mydomain.com/api/groups/.
* _Fail build if vulnerabilities_
** Trigger build failure if Protecode SC finds vulnerabilities from the
artifacts.
* _Directory for files to scan_
** The directory to scan. There is no automatic scanning of artifacts
yet (as of 0.15.1)
* Include subdirectories. Please see help for warnings.
** Include all files in a directory structure. _Please notice that this
can send massive amounts of files if the "directory to scan" is set
incorrectly._
* Regular expression for including files
** A Java 8 type regexp pattern. Please see
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html
for more information.
* _Scanning timeout (minutes)_
** The timeout for the scanning build step. If the scan operation in
protecode lasts longer than the given value, the build step will exit.
* _Convert results to Summary plugin format_
** Set to `+true+`
** The summary can be shown using Summary Display Plugin of Jenkins. The
report file name to publish is protecodesc.xml. +
 +
. *Publish XML Summary Reports* (requires
*https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Summary+Display+Plugin[Summary
Display Plugin])* +
* _Files to parse_
** Set to `+**/protecodesc.xml+`
* _Show on Project page_
** Set to `+true+`[.anchor]# +
#

[[ProtecodeSCPlugin-BuildResults]]
=== [.anchor]#Build Results +
#

* [.anchor]#[.anchor]#If you use *Summar***y Display Plugin**# the
results of all files scanned in the whole history of the build on the
right side of the builds main page.#
* [.anchor]#_Please notice that the results shown on are *all* the
results ever produced by the build._ +

* [.anchor]#If you wish to see *only the latest results* you can
manually delete the reports directory#. This is most conveniently done
in a "Execute shell" step. +
A new directory is created in place of the deleted one automatically. +
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/Screen_Shot_2018-02-07_at_18.03.04.png[image]# +
 +
* If no summary plugin is used the build will only fail if
vulnerabilities are found (as of 0.15)
** A more detailed UI to show vulnerabilities and history is being
planned currently, but no release date has been set yet (as of
7.2.2018).

Simple example, more to be added:

....
node {
    stage ("Scan files") {
....

....
        protecodesc credentialsId: 'PR2', directoryToScan: 'target', includeSubdirectories: true, protecodeScGroup: '<number>', scanTimeout: 40
....

....
    }
}
....
