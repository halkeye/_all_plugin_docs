BuildResultTrigger makes it possible to monitor the build results of
other jobs. +

[[BuildResultTriggerPlugin-Features]]
== Features

When you you have two jobs jobA and jobB and you want Jenkins to
schedule jobB after the jobA execution (whatever the build result of
jobA), you can configure Jenkins to say that jobB is the downstream job
of jobA. The drawback with this approach is that jobA has the knowledge
of its dependencies. +
With the BuildResultPlugin, you configure jobB to monitor jobA build
result. A build is scheduled if there is a new build result matches your
criteria (unstable, failure, ...)

Note: The plug-in uses only persistence in memory. There is no impact on
the Jenkins infrastructure (no new files created). +
This plugin provides a polling typology among the

Plugin].

[[BuildResultTriggerPlugin-Someusecases]]
== Some use cases

* Having dedicated jobs (such as cleaning an environment, backing up a
database, ...) that are scheduled if other jobs are in failure. +
The other jobs don't depend on these dedicated jobs. +
* Implementing a build pipeline (or a build chain) in which each step of
the build pipeline is implemented with a Jenkins job.
