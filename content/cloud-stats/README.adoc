Aggregate past cloud provisioning activities into a report.

The plugin collects activities of other plugins and visualizes them as
well as provides them to other plugins in form of an API.

Note that a provisioning plugin needs to explicitly integrate against
this plugin in order to capture its statistics.

The statistics are presented on *Manage Jenkins > Cloud Statistics*.
