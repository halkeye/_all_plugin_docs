[[SynergyPlugin-Usingmultiplenodes]]
== Using multiple nodes

It is possible to build a project on multiple nodes, by creating a copy
of the project for each node. The name of the node must be in the
Synergy project name, and a dynamic project name must be set in the
Synergy plugin.

For example, if the project names match a pattern like "project-NODE"
(where "NODE" is the name of the node), the name of the project in the
Synergy plugin must be "project-$\{COMPUTERNAME}".
