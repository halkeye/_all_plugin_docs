[[mktmpioPlugin-Summary]]
== Summary

mktmpio is a service that provides database servers on demand with
sub-second provisioning times. Each server instance is a complete
database environment with only the default database, tables, and users
created. This means you can test risky operations such as automatic role
creation and deletion or large scale schema migrations without the risk
of operating on a shared database and without the hassle of having to
deploy a server, create a VM, or even install anything. +
The mktmpio plugin for Jenkins integrates the mktmpio server with
Jenkins so that any build can include a dedicated database server that
is created at the start of the build and then automatically shutdown at
the end. Because the provisioning takes less than 1 second, there is
virtually no impact on build times.
