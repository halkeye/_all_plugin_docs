Adds the ability to monitor the result of externally executed jobs.

Jenkins is useful for monitoring the non-interactive execution of
processes, such as cron jobs, procmail, inetd-launched processes. Often
those tasks are completely unmonitored (which makes it hard for you to
notice when things go wrong), or they send e-mails constantly regardless
of the success or failure (which results into the same situation as
you'll quickly start ignoring them anyway.) Using Jenkins enables you to
monitor a large number of such tasks with little overhead.

[[Monitoringexternaljobs-Settingupaproject]]
== Setting up a project

Create a new job and choose "Monitor an external job" as the job type.

[[Monitoringexternaljobs-Monitoringanexecution]]
== Monitoring an execution

For Debian / Ubuntu:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
sudo apt-get install jenkins-external-job-monitor
# obviously you should replace localhost with a FQDN if you want to run jobs from other machines.
export JENKINS_HOME=http://@localhost:8080/
java -jar /usr/share/jenkins/external-job-monitor/java/jenkins-core-*.jar "external-build-job-name" command-to-run
java -jar /usr/share/jenkins/external-job-monitor/java/jenkins-core-*.jar "external-build-test" ls -l
----

Once you set up a project, you can monitor an execution by running a
command like this:

....
$ export JENKINS_HOME=http://user:pw@myserver.acme.org/path/to/jenkins/
$ java -jar /path/to/WEB-INF/lib/jenkins-core-*.jar "job name" <program arg1 arg2...>
....

For Windows:

....
> set JENKINS_HOME=http://user:pw@myserver.acme.org/path/to/jenkins/
> java -jar \path\to\WEB-INF\lib\jenkins-core-*.jar "job name" cmd.exe /c <program arg1 arg2...>
....

If your webserver extracts the `+jenkins.war+` file when it deploys
Jenkins then you may use the path directly to the `+WEB-INF/lib+`
directory and all other required jars will be found there. Otherwise you
may extract these from the war file:

....
jenkins-core-*.jar
remoting-*.jar
ant-1.7.0.jar
commons-io-1.4jar
commons-lang-2.4.jar
jna-posix-*.jar
xstream-*.jar
....

All are found in the `+WEB-INF/lib+` path inside the war file. As long
as they are all in the same directory, the
`+java -jar /path/to/jenkins-core-*.jar+` command will find the other
required jars.

* Note: Older versions of Jenkins (before 1.324) also require
`+winstone.jar+` in order to run this command. This jar is found at the
top level directory inside the war file, and must be manually added to
the classpath (with `+-classpath+` or `+-cp+`) in the java command.

The JENKINS_HOME variable is used to locate the server Jenkins is
running, so this must be set. Unless your Jenkins job has build
permission for guest users, include the `+username:password@+` portion
of the URL, as seen in the examples above.

* Note: Authentication via username:password in JENKINS_HOME is added in
Jenkins 1.324; with previous versions either grant anonymous build
permission on the job, or use `+curl+` to post XML to Jenkins (see
below).

You can copy `+jenkins-core-*.jar+` and the other required jars to other
machines if you want to monitor jobs that are run on a different
machine.

stdout and stderr of the program will be recorded, and a non-zero exit
code will be considered as a failure.

[[Monitoringexternaljobs-Monitoringcronjobs]]
== Monitoring cron jobs

To monitor a cron job, simply run the above set up from your cron
script. To avoid receiving e-mails from cron daemon, you might want to
write something like:

....
JENKINS_HOME=http://myserver.acme.org/path/to/jenkins/
0 * * * *     export JENKINS_HOME=$JENKINS_HOME; java -jar jenkins-core-*.jar "backup" backup.sh 2>&1 > /dev/null
....

Note that you can also move the cron job itself to Jenkins by using
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Building+a+software+project[free-style
software project], which would also allow you to manually execute the
job outside the scheduled executions.

[[Monitoringexternaljobs-Submitarunprogramatically]]
== Submit a run programatically

The above command submits the execution and its result by sending XML to
HTTP. This means you can submit an execution record from any program, as
long as you follow the same XML format.

The format is explained below:

....
<run>
  <log encoding="hexBinary">...hex binary encoded console output...</log>
  <result>... integer indicating the error code. 0 is success and everything else is failure</result>
  <duration>... milliseconds it took to execute this run ...</duration>
  <displayName>... The name to be displayed rather than the build number ...</displayName>
 Â <description>... Description of the build ...</description>
</run>
....

The `+duration+` element is optional, since 1.429 `+displayName+` and
`+description+` can also optionally be appended, these three elements
can be in any order, but must appear after log and result in that order.
Console output is hexBinary encoded so that you can pass in any control
characters that are otherwise disallowed in XML.

The above XML needs to be sent to
`+http://myhost/jenkins/job/_jobName_/postBuildResult+`.

A simple example using curl would be (using no real data; the sequence
`+4142430A+` encodes a console output of `+ABC+` plus a trailing line
feed symbol):

....
$ curl -X POST -d '<run><log encoding="hexBinary">4142430A</log><result>0</result><duration>2000</duration></run>' \
http://user:pass@myhost/jenkins/job/_jobName_/postBuildResult
....

[[Monitoringexternaljobs-SubmitarunperCLI]]
== Submit a run per CLI

The easiest option is for the execution can be submitted per CLI/ssh
command. The gzipped log file can be transported through pipe:

....
$ cat result.log.gz | ssh jenkins set-external-build-result --display 7d552c4ba_Linux_tb21 --job buildbot --result 1 -b --duration 42 --log -
....

Sometimes build number is needed, as the calling program might need to
put an URL to the submitted build. The CLI command above returns the new
build number. The command above can be called programatically from an
Java application. You can find a sample for it
https://github.com/davido/gerrit-buildbot-plugin/blob/buildbot-2.5-plugin/src/main/java/org/libreoffice/ci/gerrit/buildbot/publisher/JenkinsLogPublisher.java[here].
