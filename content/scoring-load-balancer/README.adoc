Decides a build run on which node by scoring nodes.

[[ScoringLoadBalancerplugin-What'sthis?]]
== What's this?

This plugin provides following features:

* Decides a node where a build run depending on scores of nodes.
* Provides following scoring rules. New ones can be added using
`ExtensionPoint`.
** Scoring by Build Results
*** Prefers nodes where the last builds of the project succeeded.
*** Avoids nodes where the last builds of the project failed.
** Scoring by Node Loads
*** Prefers nodes where more executers remain.
*** Avoids nodes where more builds run.
** Scoring by Node Preferences
*** Prefers nodes marked "Preferred" in configuration of the building
project.
*** Prefers nodes with labels marked "Preferred" in configuration of the
building project.
*** Prefers nodes marked "Preferred" in configuration of nodes.
* Scoring rules are configured in "Manage Jenkins" > "Configure System"
** Pick up available scoring rules and put them in preferred order.
*** Each scoring rules provides its configuration.
*** You can put scoring rules twice or more, but it might be useless for
current providing methods.

* Scoring Load Balancer plugin adds a new configuration section to
"Manage Jenkins" > "Configure System" page. You can add rules to decide
which nodes is preferred to use for building. +

that node. You can configure weights of successes and failures. +

[[ScoringLoadBalancerplugin-Howdoesthiswork?]]
== How does this work?

You may read later "WorkChunks and ExecutorChunks" first for
understanding how Jenkins works for build assignment.

This plugin works as following:

. When the plugin loaded, replaces the default `+LoadBalancer+` to
`+ScoringLoadBalancer+`.
. Jenkins requests to map builds to nodes ( `+LoadBalancer#map+`)
. Pick the first WorkChunk (that is, subtask).
. Score all nodes by calling all configured `+ScoringRule+`
* You can define a new scoring rule by creating a subclass of
`+ScoringRule+`.
. Pick the ExecutorChunk with the highest score node. Assign that
ExecutorChunk to the current WorkChunk.
. Pick the next WorkChunk, and back to 4. Scoring is performed for each
WorkChunk, for the case scores differ for each subtask.
. If assignment is failed (e.g. some constrains is broken), pick the
next ExecutorChunk, and back to 6.
. If assignment is succeeded, it is used.

== WorkChunks and ExecutorChunks

In simple cases, Jenkins launches only one build at the same time. +
Though multi-configuration project results in multiple builds even
triggered once, +
these builds are launched just one by one sequentially.

But there are cases Jenkins launches two or more builds at the same
time. +
SEE `+JobProperty#getSubTasks+` or `+SubTaskContributor+` for details.

Before builds start on node, Jenkins requests to map tasks to
executors. +
Here are definitions of words:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Word |Explanation
|Task |A root source of builds. Includes `+FreeStyleProject+`,
`+MatrixConfiguration+`. `+MatrixProject+` is also a task, but not
processed with LoadBalancer (for it is a `+FlyWeightTask+` ).

|SubTask |A task may contain multiple subtasks. One subtask creates one
build. Generally, a task contains itself as a subtask. For example, task
`+FreeStyleProject+` contains a subtask `+FreeStyleProject+` itself and
other subtasks created by `+JobProperty#getSubTasks+` or
`+SubTaskContributor+`.

|Build |A process runs on a computer. A build is created by a subtask.

|Node |One can be registered in "Manage Nodes".

|Computer |A node which is connected and builds can run on now.

|Executor |Build slots a computer provides. The number of executer of a
node can be configured with "# of executors" in "Manage Nodes" page.
|===

When Jenkins requests to map tasks to executors, +
it passes `+WorkChunk+` s and `+ExecutorChunk+` s.

`+WorkChunk+` groups subtasks that must run on a same node. Subtasks can
be grouped by `+SubTask#getSameNodeConstraint+` returning the same
`+Object+`.

`+ExecutorChunk+` groups executors by their computers (that is by
nodes).

[[ScoringLoadBalancerplugin-Extensionpoint]]
== Extension point

New scoring rule can be added with extending `+ScoringRule+`, overriding
the following method:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
public abstract boolean updateScores(Task task, WorkChunk wc, Mapping m, NodesScore nodesScore);
----

You can score nodes by updating `+nodesScore+`.

[[ScoringLoadBalancerplugin-Limitations]]
== Limitations

* A performance problem may occurs for a large number of nodes.
** I've tested the behavior with only 10 nodes.
