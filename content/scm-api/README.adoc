[[SCMAPIPlugin-Version2.2.6(Dec13,2017)]]
=== Version 2.2.6 (Dec 13, 2017)

* Enhanced the mock implementation test harness to allow testing
SCMSource.afterSave() and SCMNavigator.afterSave() (no changes to user
code)

[[SCMAPIPlugin-Version2.2.5(Nov3,2017)]]
=== Version 2.2.5 (Nov 3, 2017)

* Add a utility API to allow implementation plugins to use a standard
mechanism for normalizing SCM URIs in order to assist comparisons (no
user visible changes)

[[SCMAPIPlugin-Version2.2.4(Nov2,2017)]]
=== Version 2.2.4 (Nov 2, 2017)

* Clarify the help text for the built in filters. The built in filters
treat the SCMHead name as a name, no special processing. A lot of people
were wondering why when they set a filter like `+master feature/*+` why
none of the PRs were building... the reason being that `+PR-123+` does
not match the filter. When using the filters built in to SCM-API you
probably want something like `+master feature/* PR-*+` to get PRs to
build. An alternative filter implementation that probably does what you
actually want
is https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/SCM+Filter+Branch+PR+Plugin[SCM
Filter Branch PR Plugin] as that will filter non-change requests like
the built in filters but has a special case for PRs where instead it
filters those based on the PR target head rather than the name of the PR
(which will always be PR-... unless the SCMSource uses a different
prefix for its change request concept

 Please read https://jenkins.io/blog/2017/01/17/scm-api-2/[this Blog
Post] before upgrading

after the chain of releases is done - SC)

[[SCMAPIPlugin-Version2.0.1-beta-1(Dec16,2016)]]
=== Version 2.0.1-beta-1 (Dec 16, 2016)

* Released to experimental update center to allow testing the downstream
changes in github-branch-source and bitbucket-branch-source (both of
which need upgrading to at least 2.0.0-beta-1 if you have them installed
on your master)

[[SCMAPIPlugin-Version2.0(Dec7,2016)]]
=== Version 2.0 (Dec 7, 2016)

* https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-38987[JENKINS-38987]
Added pronouns to assist consuming plugins to name concepts like:
SCMHead; SCMSource; and SCMNavigator with SCM specific idiomatic names,
e.g. GitHub can respectively provide pronouns "Branch"/"Tag"/"Pull
request"; "Repository"; "Server", whereas something like Accurev could
provide pronouns "Stream"/"Snapshot"; "Depot"; "Repository". The
pronouns are more relevant for SCMHead as typically each SCM
implementation is likely to have more than one type of head: mainlines,
branches, tags, change requests, etc
* https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-38355[JENKINS-39355] Various
API improvements that make it easier to implement/consume SCM API
including the addition of an event system to allow SCM implementations
to consolidate push event handling from their backing SCM server.
* https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-40138[JENKINS-40138] SCMHead.getActions()
should never have been introduced into the SCM API. JENKINS-33309 was a
mistake. The API is now marked as DoNotUse and is non-functional.
Replacement API for the correct way to access the corresponding
information have been documented.
* Added documentation for
https://github.com/jenkinsci/scm-api-plugin/blob/master/docs/implementation.adoc[plugin
authors who are implementing the SCM API for their SCM system] and
https://github.com/jenkinsci/scm-api-plugin/blob/master/docs/consumer.adoc[consumers
of the SCM API that want to access different SCM implementations through
a single generic API]
* Added
a https://github.com/jenkinsci/scm-api-plugin/tree/master/src/test/java/jenkins/scm/impl/mock[mock
SCM implementation] in the tests-jar so that consumers can write unit
tests of their implementation without needing to create SCM servers and
manipulate SCM repositories to generate events or test conditions.

[[SCMAPIPlugin-Version1.3(Sep7,2016)]]
=== Version 1.3 (Sep 7, 2016)

* Infrastructure for
https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-31155[JENKINS-31155].
