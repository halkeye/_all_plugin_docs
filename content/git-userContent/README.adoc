Jenkins has a mechanism known as
"https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/User+Content[User
Content]", where administrators can place files inside
`+$JENKINS_HOME/userContent+`, and these files are served from
`+http://yourhost/jenkins/userContent+`. This can be thought of as a
mini HTTP server to serve images, stylesheets, and other static
resources that you can use from various description fields inside
Jenkins.

This plugin exposes this `+$JENKINS_HOME/userContent+` directory as a
Git repository, allowing administrators to use git to push/pull changes
and manage them with history.

Once this plugin is installed, see
http://yourserver/jenkins/userContent.git in your browser for how to
access this repository.
