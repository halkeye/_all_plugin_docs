*This plugin is up for adoption.* Want to help improve this plugin?
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Adopt+a+Plugin[Click here to
learn more]!

[.conf-macro .output-inline]##This plugin allows you to publish TestNG
results generated using `+org.testng.reporters.XMLReporter+`.##TestNG
result xml file contains more information than the junit report xml file
. This plugin exposes those extra information in graph and table
reports.

This plugin makes it possible to import TestNG XML reports from each
build into Jenkins.

The data is parsed using the output generated using
`+org.testng.reporters.XMLReporter+`. The results are displayed with a
trend graph and all details about which tests that failed are also
presented.

[[testng-plugin-Features]]
== Features

The page layouts are intentionally designed to look very similar to
Jenkins's JUnit plugin.

* In the project/build page you can see a summary of passed/fail tests
as well as passed/fail configuration methods. It also enlists the failed
test cases with a direct link to view the test failure.

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .image-center-wrapper]#image:docs/images/test-summary.png[image]#

* In the Class result summary page test methods are separated from
configuration methods

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .image-center-wrapper]#image:docs/images/test-result.png[image]#

* In the Package result summary you can see the order which test methods
were ran during the regression run.

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .image-center-wrapper]#image:docs/images/execution-order.png[image]#

* Different graphs will show you the pass/failed trend of job's previous
results.

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .image-center-wrapper]#image:docs/images/test-graph.png[image]#

* Able to hide/expand tables that display package and class results

[[testng-plugin-Usage]]
== Usage

Once you have configured your build to run TestNG based test cases and
also generate the TestNG specific result XML, using this plugin is very
simple. In *Post-Build Actions*, simply enable *Publish TestNG Results*.
This option allows you to configure the following properties:

* *TestNG XML report pattern*: This is a file name pattern that can be
used to locate the TestNG XML report files (for example
***/target/testng-results.xml*). The path is an Ant-style pattern (e.g.
fileset) or a list of files and folders separated by the characters
'*_;:,_*'. TestNG must be configured to generate XML reports using
_org.testng.reporters.XMLReporter _for this plug-in to function.
* *Escape Test Description string?*: If checked, the plug-in escapes the
description string associated with the test method while displaying test
method details. Unchecking this allows you to use HTML tags to format
the description. (_enabled by default_).
* *Escape exception messages?*: If checked, the plug-in escapes the test
method's exception messages. Unchecking this allows you to use HTML tags
to format the exception message e.g. embed links in the text. (_enabled
by default_)
* *Show Failed Builds?*: If checked, the plug-in includes results from
failed builds in the trend graph. (Disabled by default). 
** If this is a maven build, it is better to configure the build step
with `+-Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true+` option. This results in build
with test failures being marked as Unstable, thus distinguishing it from
build that failed because of non test related issues 
** Even when this option is selected, failed builds with no results and
aborted builds will not be displayed in graphs
* **Mark build as unstable on Skipped config/test methods?**: Marks the
build unstable of skipped configuration or test methods are found in
results. If build result is worse that UNSTABLE, this option has no
effect
* *Mark build as failure on failed configuration?*: Marks the build as
failed if there are any configuration method failures
* *Thresholds for marking the build as Unstable/Failed*: User can
configure a Threshold Mode as number of tests or percentage of tests and
then configure these values separately as well. This allows for
scenarios where we want the builds to be marked successful even when
there are some test failures or mark the build as failed even if there
is a single test method failure.
