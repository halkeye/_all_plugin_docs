[.conf-macro .output-inline]#Allows Jenkins to build merge requests from
https://assembla.com/[Assembla].#

This plugin fetches the source and target branches of a
https://assembla.com/[Assembla] merge request and makes them available
to your build via build parameters. Once the build completes, Jenkins
will leave a comment on the merge request and related tickets indicating
whether the merge request was successful.

[[AssemblaMergeRequestBuilderPlugin-Contributing]]
== Contributing

* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been
implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't
requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it
in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the version, or history. If you want to
have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but
please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
