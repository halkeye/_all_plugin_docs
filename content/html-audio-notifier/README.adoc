[[HtmlAudioNotifier-Troubleshooting]]

similar responses
* If all else fails, firebug is your friend

[[HtmlAudioNotifier-Changelog]]
== Changelog

[[HtmlAudioNotifier-Version0.4(2011-11-25)]]
=== Version 0.4 (2011-11-25)

immediate audio feedback, without excessive polling.

for the plugin

[[HtmlAudioNotifier-Version0.2(2011-10-02)]]
