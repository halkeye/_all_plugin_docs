Commit Message Trigger Plugin

[[CommitMessageTriggerPlugin-Setup]]
=== Setup

This allows you when using a gitflow/hubflow to have Jenkins monitor
feature branches but only build/merge develop when a feature has been
completed by having the developer add [ci build] in the final commit.  
This skips the step of creating a pull request in the general gitflow
methodology.  You could also use [ci deploy] to cause a job which
deploys to a staging server to run.

A skipped build will be marked as NOT BUILT, not FAILED or SUCCESS.
