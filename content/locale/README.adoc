This plugin controls the language of JenkinsNormally, Jenkins honors the
browser's language preference if a translation is available for the
preferred language, and uses the system default locale for messages
during a build. This plugin allows you to:

* override the system default locale to the language of your choice
* ignore browser's language preference completely

This feature is sometimes convenient for multi-lingual environment.

[[LocalePlugin-Usage]]
== Usage

Under Manage Jenkins > Configure System there should be a "Locale"
section.

Here you can enter the "Default Language": this should be a language
code or locale code like "fr" (for French), or "de_AT" (German, in
Austria).

This value will be used by the system, for example, for messages that
are printed to the log during a build (assuming that the Jenkins
features and plugins that you're using have been translated into the
specified language).

To additionally force this language on all users, overriding their
browser language, you can check the "Ignore browser preference and force
this language to all users" option.
