[.conf-macro .output-inline]#This plugin generates Doxygen documentation
and publishes HTML reports generated by the
http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/[Doxygen] tool. #

[[DoxygenPlugin-Description]]
== Description

Doxygen is a documentation system for C++, C, Java and others
languages. +
The hudson doxygen plugin makes it possible to parse the Doxygen
descriptor (Doxyfile) and generate the documentation. It can also
provide a link to the generated Doxygen documentation (even if it hasn't
been generated by the plugin itself). +
The generated Doxygen documentation can be retained for each successful
build.
