the jobs status from all your Jenkins servers in one view, you can use
this plugin to have them all in one view

[[RemoteJobsViewPlugin-KnownIssues]]
== Known Issues

* In case your remote Jenkins is only accessible via HTTPS you must
include the remote server certificate in your Java trust store. +
Or (if you really know what you're doing!) you could also add the
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Skip+Certificate+Check+plugin[Skip
Certificate Check Plugin] to your Jenkins (which is running this view
plugin) in order to skip any certificate check
* Selecting 1/3 as width (for 3 remote servers - one left, one central,
one right) does not align the views correct
