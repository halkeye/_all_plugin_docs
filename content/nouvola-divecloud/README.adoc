real-world ready scenarios and in-depth performance analytics across any

*Installation*

First, sign up for a free account
at https://divecloud.nouvola.com/[Nouvola DiveCloud] and obtain:

*  A *Nouvola API key *(located in Account -> API & Keys).
*  Create a new test plan and copy the *test plan ID. *

*Optional steps:*

* You can delay the polling for test results by using Wait Time. For
example if your test lasts 10 minutes, you can set Wait Time to 10.
* **I**f you want to be notified when your test completes using the
Nouvola DiveCloud *Webhook* service, enter the URL of your Jenkins
server (e.g.:
http://jenkinsserver.yourcompany.com:12345/[http://jenkinsserver.yourcompany.com:12345]),
and the test will send a message when the execution is completed. 

*Note*: the URL needs to be accessible by external sources. Make sure
the specified port is open. If no port is specified in the URL, the
listening port will default to 9999.

* You can set a timeout value so that your step will continue even if
the webhook is never called. 

You can then enter this information as a build step, which will run a
test from the DiveCloud platform during your build. If you setup
multiple build steps with Nouvola tests, they may run either at the same
time or one after another.
