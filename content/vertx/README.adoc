This plugin enables an embedded, clustered http://vertx.io/[Vert.x]
instance within Jenkins. It exposes various events – such as run
completions, item creates and updates, etc. – as messages on the Vert.x
EventBus. It also allows verticles to act as
http://javadoc.jenkins-ci.org/byShortName/QueueTaskDispatcher[QueueTaskDispatchers].

See the https://github.com/jenkinsci/vertx-plugin#readme[README] and
https://github.com/jenkinsci/vertx-plugin/wiki[wiki] for more
information.

[[Vert.xEmbedder-Requirements]]
== Requirements

Vert.x requires Java 7, therefore the Jenkins instance must be running
on Java 7. Given that support for Java 6 ends in about 3 months, this
shouldn't be a major concern.
