== Polarion Plugin

[.conf-macro .output-inline]#This plugin integrates the
http://www.polarion.com/products/svn/svn_webclient.php[Polarion
WebClient for SVN], an open source, web based interface to Subversion.#

Configuration simply involves choosing 'Polarion Web Client' as the
repository browser when configuring a project to use Subversion as its
source code management.

Once configured, the change logs of a build will provide links to the
specific Subversion revision as well as the color coded difference views
within Polarion WebClient.

Note that JIRA also integrates the Polarion WebClient as a web based
viewer of subversion changes related to issues. When coupled with the
Jenkins https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/JIRA+Plugin[JIRA
Plugin] this combination provides a very useful integration between
source control viewing, issue tracking and continuous integration and
builds.
