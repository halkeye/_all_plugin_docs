Recommended Jenkins version for Mail Watcher Plugin is 1.554. Using
earlier version (earlier than 1.551) will cause missing notification for
events that was not supported in the particular version.

Notify when Node online status changes. Recipients are configured at
node configuration page, section Node Properties. Recipients are
notified when one of these events occurs:

* http://javadoc.jenkins-ci.org/hudson/slaves/ComputerListener.html#onOffline(hudson.model.Computer)[onOffline]
* http://javadoc.jenkins-ci.org/hudson/slaves/ComputerListener.html#onOnline(hudson.model.Computer,%20hudson.model.TaskListener)[onOnline]

* http://javadoc.jenkins-ci.org/hudson/slaves/ComputerListener.html#onTemporarilyOnline(hudson.model.Computer)[onTemporarilyOnline]

Computer configuration offers two recipients lists for users to be
notified on either online or offline event.

[[MailWatcherPlugin-Implicitnotifications]]
==== Implicit notifications

* User is notified when the node he/she put offline becomes available.
In other words: last build has finished and no new can be scheduled.
(Since 1.551)
