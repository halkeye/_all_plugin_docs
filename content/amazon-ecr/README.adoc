This plugin offers integration with Amazon EC2 Container Registry (ECR)
as a DockerRegistryToken source to convert Amazon Credentials into a
Docker CLI Authentication Token.

[[AmazonECR-About]]
== About

Amazon ECR plugin implements a Docker Token producer to convert Amazon
credentials to Jenkins’ API used by (mostly) all Docker-related
plugins. +
Thank's to this producer, you can select your existing registered Amazon
credentials for various Docker operations in Jenkins, for sample using
CloudBees Docker Build and Publish plugin:

[[AmazonECR-DockerPipelineUsage]]
== Docker Pipeline Usage

When using the
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/CloudBees+Docker+Pipeline+Plugin[CloudBees
Docker Pipeline Plugin], in order to obtain an ECR login credential, you
must use the ecr provider prefix.

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
docker.withRegistry("https://your.ecr.domain.amazonws.com", "ecr:us-east-1:credential-id") {
  docker.image("your-image-name").push()
}
----

 

If you experience authentication issues, you would try to remove user
docker configuration files on the agents before to run the docker
commands, something like this pipeline script.

 

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
node {
        //cleanup current user docker credentials
        sh 'rm  ~/.dockercfg || true'
        sh 'rm ~/.docker/config.json || true'
        
        //configure registry
        docker.withRegistry('https://ID.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com', 'ecr:eu-west-1:86c8f5ec-1ce1-4e94-80c2-18e23bbd724a') {
          
            //build image
            def customImage = docker.build("my-image:${env.BUILD_ID}")
            
            //push image
            customImage.push()
        }
