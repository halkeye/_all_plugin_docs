[.conf-macro .output-inline]#This plugin runs your jobs in the
http://rvm.io/[RVM] managed ruby+gemset of your choice#.

[[RVMPlugin-Features]]
== Features

* Runs your entire build (from SCM check out to post-build actions)
within the context of an RVM managed environment of your choice (as
opposed to your doing "source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm && rvm foo@bar", which
only affects your current shell)
* If the Ruby/gemset you specified doesn't exist on a slave that the
build is running, it'll be automatically installed and created (via
`+rvm_install_on_use_flag+`)

[[RVMPlugin-Configuration]]
== Configuration

Once this plugin is installed, you'll see the "Run the build in a
RVM-managed environment" option under the "Build Environment" section.
Click the checkbox, then type in the Ruby implementation name in the
text box. The implementation name is of the form `+RUBY[@GEMEST]+`. See
http://rvm.io/rubies/installing/[the RVM documentation] and the output
of `+rvm list known+` for possible values.
