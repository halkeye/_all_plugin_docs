[[UiPathPlugin-UiPathPack:]]
== UiPath Pack:

Can be used within a build sequence or a pipeline and does the packaging
of one or more UiPath projects given their source code.

*Versioning Method*

The versioning of the package or packages that are created in this task
can be done in two ways:

* Using the Auto-generate **the package version** option that will
pseudo-randomly generate a version following the same algorithm that
UiPath Studio uses when publishing to Orchestrator.
* Using custom versioning like \{MAJOR}.$\{MINOR}.$\{BUILD_NUMBER}.
Semantic versioning is supported.

*Project(s) Path*

Here you can specify either a path to a single project or a path to a
directory that contains multiple other projects. You can have the
following situations:

path\to\invoice_processing\project.json - it packages
invoice_processing;

path\to\invoice_processing - it packages invoice_processing;

path\to\invoicing_projects\ where this folder contains the following:

* path\to\invoicing_projects\PROJECT_A\
* path\to\invoicing_projects\PROJECT_B\
* path\to\invoicing_projects\directory_with_other_projects\

In this case, the plugin packages individually only PROJECT_A and
PROJECT_B, the result being one NuGet package for each one of them.  

*Output Folder*

This is where the NuGet packages that were produced by the plugin are
going to be stored.

One possible path could be:
$\{JENKINS_HOME}\jobs\$\{JOB_NAME}\builds\$\{BUILD_NUMBER}\.

In this case, each build folder contains the NuGet package(s) that the
build yeilds.

[[UiPathPlugin-UiPathDeploy:]]
== UiPath Deploy:

Enables you to deploy a process automation package or multiple to a
specific Orchestrator tenant. The task requires the following
information: the path from where to take the packages and of course
Orchestrator related information: URL, tenant name, and user credentials
to perform the API calls.  

An example of **Package(s) path** is:
$\{JENKINS_HOME}\jobs\$\{JOB_NAME}\builds\$\{BUILD_NUMBER}\.

The UiPath Deploy task takes the latest version of each NuGet package
from the specified folder and deletes the older ones.  keeping in the
folder only the ones with the latest versions.

Using Environment Variables

You can use environment variables in all text boxes of both **Pack** and
**Deploy** tasks. Use the following format: $\{WORKSPACE},
$\{JENKINS_HOME}, etc.

Prerequisites for the Build Agent Machine

. A reachable Orchestrator instance at which the packages are to be
deployed;
. SSL Certificate should be imported so the HTTPS calls to Orchestrator
can be trusted;
. UiPath Robot, minimum version 18.3.2, installed in C:\Program Files
(x86)\UiPath\Studio.

== Example of usage #1: Packing and deploying a build job

This example is meant to showcase the UiPath Jenkins Plugin capabilities
but also the scenario can be replicated for the following use-case:

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/image2019-4-20_0-26-41.png[image]#

These are the steps to set up a simple pack and deploy build job:

. Create a new item.
* [.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/image2019-4-20_1-30-55.png[image]#
. Choose Freestyle Project.
* [.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/image2019-4-20_1-31-54.png[image]#
. Specify the source code repository of the project you want to pack and
deploy.This UiPath project has its own repository. You need to create
upfront your set of credentials for this operation. For configuring
credentials in Jenkins please follow
https://support.cloudbees.com/hc/en-us/articles/203802500-Injecting-Secrets-into-Jenkins-Build-Jobs[this
guide.] 
* [.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/image2019-4-20_1-33-13.png[image]#
. Add UiPath Pack as a build step.
* [.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/image2019-4-20_1-35-3.png[image]#
. Configure UiPath Pack as follows:
* [.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/image2019-4-20_1-35-37.png[image]#
* Specify the package versioning pattern to help track packages back to
their build jobs and sources. In this example, $\{BUILD_NUMBER} is a
Jenkins environment variable which gets incremented with each build for
this project. The first two numbers of the version, MAJOR and MINOR, can
also be configured depending on the project status.
* Sources from the GIT repository are checked-out in the $\{WORKSPACE}
folder, so that should be the **Project path**. Remember, in this
example we’re packaging and deploying only one project.
* The result of this operation is stored in the specified **Output
folder**. In Jenkins, each build has its own folder so it’s best to have
the results placed in:
$\{JENKINS_HOME}\jobs\$\{JOB_NAME}\builds\$\{BUILD_NUMBER}\.
. Add UiPath Deploy as a post-build step.
* [.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/image2019-4-20_1-35-56.png[image]#
. Configure UiPath Deploy as shown below. For **Package(s) path** it is
recommended to use the same folder given as Output for the Pack
task. Also, the credentials for Orchestrator should be defined
separately in **Jenkins Credentials Manager**.
* [.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/image2019-4-20_1-36-17.png[image]#
. Run the build job. As a result, the latest version of the project is
taken from source control, a NuGet package is  created and deployed to
the specified Orchestrator.

[[UiPathPlugin-Exampleofusage#2:CreatingaJenkinspipelinethatpackagesaUiPathprojectanddeploysitacrossmultiplestages]]
== Example of usage #2: Creating a Jenkins pipeline that packages a UiPath project and deploys it across multiple stages

This example showcases how the UiPath Jenkins Plugin works with Jenkins
Pipelines. However, please note that it can also be replicated for an
RPA development context that involves multiple stages with approvals for
package promotion.

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/image2019-4-20_1-37-1.png[image]#

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/image2019-4-20_1-37-31.png[image]#

Here are the steps for creating such a pipeline:

. Create a new pipeline.
* [.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/image2019-4-20_1-37-58.png[image]#
. Parametrize the pipeline so that you can repurpose it later on with
other projects, as displayed below:
* [.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/image2019-4-20_1-38-54.png[image]#
. Set-up the best-fit build triggers for your project depending on your
governance model and project life-cycle:
* [.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/image2019-4-20_1-39-10.png[image]#
. Configure the stages in the pipeline and what should be executed in
each of them. This is done by writing code. The code can be defined at
pipeline level in Jenkins (Pipeline script) or kept in the source
control repository (Pipeline script from SCM). In this example we’re
gonna use Pipeline script option:
* [.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/image2019-4-20_1-39-38.png[image]#
* And here’s the sample code for it: +

{empty}5. Save this generic pipeline. It you want to use it for a
different project, just clone the generic one and customize the
following information: pipeline name, git project repository, git
credentials id, and the list of approvers.

Please note that within the pipeline script, UiPathPack is directly
invoked to create the NuGet package after checking-out the sources from
SCM. However, the Orchestrator publishing part is done by invoking
dedicated jobs:

build job: 'deploy-in-staging' or 'deploy-in-production'

This job needs to be created and configured properly for interacting
with Orchestrator instances/tenants:

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/image2019-4-20_1-47-19.png[image]#

The advantage for externalizing the publishing part is that the
Orchestrator Address, Tenant, and Credentials are handled separately
from the build pipeline, reducing the risk of unauthorized users getting
this information.
