This is a simple plugin that changes the next build number Jenkins will
use for a job. +
This plugin is typically useful if you are using the build number as
part of a version string, and:

* You do a build outside of Jenkins and you want to skip that number for
the next build to avoid duplicate version numbers or failures.
* You created a new job to handle an existing process and want it to
continue from where the old one left off.

Jenkins requires that *build numbers are always increasing*. When you
click on the link installed by this plugin, a text field will be shown
that contains the next build number to be used. You can change this
number to be anything larger than the value for the previous build.
*Changing this to a smaller number will do nothing*.

The value can be changed:

* Graphically by using the Set Next Build Number *link* for each job
(see screenshot)
* Via the CLI using the `+set-next-build-number+` command (Requires >=
v1.1)
* Programmatically via the *Job DSL* plugin
(see https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Next+Build+Number+Plugin#NextBuildNumberPlugin-JobDSL[usage]).
(Requires >= v1.3 of this plugin and Job DSL >= 1.41)
