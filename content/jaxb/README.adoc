This plugin is an API plugin aimed at easing the transition for plugins
to run correctly in Jenkins running in Java 11. 

*As an end user, you should generally never have to install this plugin
yourself. It is designed to be automatically installed as a dependency
for plugins needing to access the JAXB API that has been removed from
the JDK in Java 9+.*

[[JAXBPlugin-Fordevelopers]]
== For developers

If you are a developer and your plugin is using JAXB and you cannot
remove the dependency:

* If your minimum baseline is < 2.164, you should consider adding an
explicitly dependency against it. 
* if your minimum baseline is >= 2.164, you *must* add the dependency
against this plugin so your plugin doesn't crash while running on a JRE
11.
