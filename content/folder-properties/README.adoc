A Jenkins plugin which allows users with config permission to define
properties for a folder which can then be used by any jobs contained
within it or any of its sub-folders. 

You can find https://github.com/jenkinsci/folder-properties-plugin[this
plugin's source code on Github].

 

[[FolderPropertiesPlugin-AboutthisPlugin]]
== About this Plugin

The aim here is to remove the need to specify the same properties over
and over again for all the jobs inside a folder.

In structures where two or more folders are nested, any property defined
for a folder will be overridden by any other property of the same name
defined by one of its sub-folders.

[[FolderPropertiesPlugin-ConfiguringFolderProperties]]
=== Configuring Folder Properties

Just create a
https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/CloudBees+Folders+Plugin[folder],
go to its configuration page and add as many properties as you need
under the `+Folder Properties+` section.

[[FolderPropertiesPlugin-FreestyleJobs]]
=== Freestyle Jobs

Freestyle jobs must opt into the `+Folder Properties+` build wrapper
from the `+Build Environment+` section of their configuration page in
order to be able to access these properties as they would any other
environment variable.

[[FolderPropertiesPlugin-PipelineJobs]]
=== Pipeline Jobs

Pipeline jobs can use step `+withFolderProperties+` to access them:

*Using folder properties in a pipeline job*

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
withFolderProperties{
    echo("Foo: ${env.FOO}")
}
----

Jenkins deployments using some of the older versions of the
https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Structs+plugin[Structs Plugin]
will need to do this using the `+wrap+` meta-step:

*Using folder properties in older pipeline jobs*

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
wrap([$class: 'ParentFolderBuildWrapper']) {
    echo("Foo: ${env.FOO}")
}
----

[[FolderPropertiesPlugin-JobDSL]]
=== Job DSL

In Job DSL scripts you can define folder properties like so:

*Job DSL example*

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
folder('my folder') {
    properties {
        folderProperties {
            properties {
                stringProperty {
                    key('FOO')
                    value('foo1')
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
----
