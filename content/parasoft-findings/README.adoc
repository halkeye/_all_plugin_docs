Since 10.4.2 this plugin has been integrated with
the https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Warnings+Next+Generation+Plugin[Warnings
Next Generation Plugin] to visualize static analysis results. Make a
copy of all your job configuration settings prior to upgrading from a
previous version of the Parasoft Findings Plugin for Jenkins. All
settings from previous versions, such as the location of the report.xml
files, will be lost after upgrading. You will need to re-apply your
configuration settings after the upgrade.

[[ParasoftFindingsPlugin-Introduction]]
== Introduction

The Parasoft Findings Plugin for Jenkins allows you to visualize static
analysis and test results in Jenkins. It converts XML reports generated
by Parasoft products into trend graphs and enables you to conveniently
view the details or easily navigate to rule documentation. The plugin
can be used with Freestyle, Maven, and Pipeline jobs.

The plugin can consume the following report types:

* Functional test reports generated by Parasoft SOAtest 9.x.
* Static analysis, metrics analysis, and unit test reports generated by
10.x versions of C/C++test, Jtest, and dotTEST.
