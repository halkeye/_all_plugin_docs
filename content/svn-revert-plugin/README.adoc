Automatically reverts SVN commits for a build if build status is changed
from successful to unstable.

Commits are only reverted if all files in the commit can be reverted,
and if no files in the commit are changed during the build.

* It currently only works for jobs with a *single module*, or with
multiple modules from the *same repository*.
* If version controlled files are *changed* in the workspace, they may
be *committed* when files are reverted.

[[SVNRevertPlugin-Configuration]]
== Configuration

To enable for a job, add (or check) the post-build action "Revert
commits that breaks the build".

To disable reverting of multiple commits, check the option "Revert even
if failing build contains multiple commits" in the global Jenkins
configuration.
