This plugin requires that you manually start it to back up your data.

For automated periodic backups, check out the
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/thinBackup[thinBackup]
plugin.

[[BackupPlugin-Description]]
== Description

The Backup plugin adds a new *Backup manager* item in the *Manage
Jenkins* page. This item allows (cf. screenshot below):

* Tweaking backup settings (using the *Setup* link)
* Backuping Jenkins's configuration (using the *Backup Jenkins
configuration* link)
* Restoring Jenkins's configuration from a previous backup (using the
*Restore Jenkins configuration* link)

Alternatives to this plugin

There are two other alternatives to this plugin:

* The
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/SCM+Sync+configuration+plugin[SCM
Sync configuration plugin] allows automatically tracking changes brought
to the global configuration of Jenkins and to the jobs configuration
into a configuration management system (Subversion, etc.).
* The https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/thinBackup[thinBackup]
plugin focuses on backuping Jenkins's global configuration and jobs
configuration. It also offers a scheduling feature (if you think the
efforts on this plugin and the Backup one should be merged, just notify
us!).

So pick the one which fits your needs
