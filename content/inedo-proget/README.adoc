plugin integrates Inedo ProGet with Jenkins allowing Jenkins jobs to
create and upload, or download and extract, universal packages.It
requires ProGet version 4.0.12 or higher to work correctly.

[[InedoProGetPlugin-Usage]]
== Usage

*First*, you need to ensure that an api key as been configured in ProGet
at ProGet > Administration > API Keys & Access Logs 

Without this the plugin will still work to a certain point but will have
reduced functionality in the job configuration - i.e. you will need to
fill in certain details rather than select values from a drop down list,
of feeds, groups and packages.

*Next*, you need to go to Jenkins' system config screen to tell Jenkins
where's your ProGet installation resides and the username and password
of a user with permission to upload files to ProGet.

*Finally*, you need to add either an "ProGet Upload Package" or "ProGet
Download Package" build step to your Jenkins job.

space that you'd like to package, supplying some metadata that that
