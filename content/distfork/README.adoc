Turns a Jenkins cluster into a general purpose batch job execution
environment through an SSH-like CLI.

 +
This plugin adds a new command 'distfork' to
https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+CLI[Jenkins CLI], which
can be used to execute arbitrary command on a slave of your choice. The
distfork command is modeled after ssh, but it's Jenkins aware — for
example, instead of hardcoding a machine name, you can specify a label
to let Jenkins choose a slave. This opens up a Jenkins cluster for doing
all kinds of things without requiring a job/build notion.

[[DistForkPlugin-UseCase]]
== Use Case

* You have a test that involves multiple nodes. Your test script can use
`+distfork+` to launch additional JVMs on the Jenkins cluster to carry
that out. Such test script can be run from both within Jenkins or from
developer's laptops.
* You have some computation that is expensive or require specific
environment (say, building JDK or building a virtual machine image.) You
can submit such computation to Jenkins from your shell.
* As a basis for distributed scripting.

[[DistForkPlugin-Usage]]
== Usage

The following example runs "uname -a" command on a slave with the
'linux' label (if the -l option is optional.)

....
$ java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://server/jenkins/ dist-fork -l linux uname -a
[distfork5384565281499633486.tmp] $ uname -a
Linux bear 2.6.28-13-generic #44-Ubuntu SMP Tue Jun 2 07:55:09 UTC 2009 x86_64 GNU/Linux
....

The following example starts a Tomcat somewhere in a Jenkins cluster,
with a port-forwarding from the port 9999 to the HTTP listener of
Tomcat.

....
% java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://localhost:8080/ dist-fork -z ~/apache-tomcat-5.5.27.tar.gz \\
    -L 9999:localhost:8080 apache-tomcat-5.5.27/bin/catalina.sh run

[[DistForkPlugin-Features]]
== Features

* `+distfork+` executions are scheduled in the queue and run by an
executor, just like normal builds. Thus it makes Jenkins aware of what
slaves are busy and what are not.
* Each command execution gets a one-time temporary directory for its
working directory. Jenkins will clean this up after the command exits,
as well as terminating any remaining background processes to maintain
the cluster health.
* Port-forwarding both ways so that you can talk to the remote process
without knowing their actual IP addresses.
* Ability to stage the files before the process execution, and ability
to bring back files after it ends.

[[DistForkPlugin-AvailableCommandLineArguments]]
== Available Command Line Arguments

....
 -F LOCAL=REMOTE   : Remote files to be copied back to local locations after
                     the execution of a task
 -L PORT:HOST:PORT : Local to remote port forwarding
 -R PORT:HOST:PORT : Remote to local port forwarding
 -Z FILE           : Bring back the newly added/updated files in the target
                     remote machine after the end of the command by creating a
                     zip/tgz bundle and place this in the local file system by
                     this name.
 -d N              : Estimated duration of this task in milliseconds, or -1 if
                     unknown
 -e NAME=VAL       : Environment variables to set to the launched process
 -f REMOTE=LOCAL   : Local files to be copied to remote locations before the
                     exeuction of a task
 -l VAL            : Label for controlling where to execute this command
 -n VAL            : Human readable name that describe this command. Used in
                     Jenkins' UI.
 -z FILE           : Zip/tgz file to be extracted into the target remote
                     machine before execution of the command
....

[[DistForkPlugin-Notes]]
== Notes

* The `+-z+` `+-Z+` -f -F `+-L+` and `+-R+` options (file and port
forwarding) will not work in a Jenkins with remoting based cli disabled
(https://jenkins.io/blog/2017/04/11/new-cli/[blog post on new CLI]),
except in 1.7+ with some modes of `+-z+` and `+-Z+`.
