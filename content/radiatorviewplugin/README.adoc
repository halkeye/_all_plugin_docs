Provides a job view displaying project status in a highly visible
manner. This is ideal for displaying on a screen on the office wall as a
form of Extreme Feedback Device.

  +
Once the plugin is installed, click on the add view tab and select
"Radiator View". The job selection options are the same as the standard
list view -- either select projects to include or specify a regular
expression to select the options.  +
This plugin will be integrated with the claim plugin if it is installed
- claimed failures are displayed in a column on the right. +

[[RadiatorViewPlugin-Example:]]
== Example:

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/radiatorview-projects.png[image]# +
This is showing a Radiator in 'Project' based mode - jobs with a common
prefix are grouped together and represented as a single box on the
screen. 

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/radiatorview-jobs.png[image]#

* Green boxes are shown when all jobs are successful. 
* Red boxes are shown when any jobs fail (including test failures).
Links to the failed builds and details of possible culprits if known are
also shown. 
* Amber boxes are shown when jobs fail, but all failing jobs are
claimed. Details of the claims are also shown. 

Hovering over the project name opens a list of all jobs relating to that
project as in the top-left project. Hovering over the ? button provides
configuration options. 

There are several different approaches to displaying the radiator,
including non-project based and only showing failing builds - give it a
try to see some of them. 

[[RadiatorViewPlugin-Compatibility]]
== Compatibility

https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-20415[JENKINS-20415] causes
views of this type to fail to be displayed (see
https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-20664[JENKINS-20664] for
details) if there are any multi-combination (matrix) jobs defined.

This applies to Jenkins 1.532.1 as well as some number of releases after
1.531 until 1.539. 1.40 has no compatibility issues.

As a workaround, when running on problematic Jenkins core releases,
uncheck "Recurse in subfolders" in the view.

balls
