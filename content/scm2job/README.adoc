Finds jobs by their SCM URL.

 +
 +

This plugin finds all jobs that use a certain Git or Subversion
repository URL.

*Given* you have a lot of jobs (say 2000) organised in 20 team masters +
*and* the jobs poll about 30 SVN repositories every minute located on
one SVN server +
*and* you are not allowed or able to install post-commit hooks, +
*then* each job will execute at least 15 WEBDAV commands per poll,
resulting 30,000 HTTP requests per second.

*Most of the status updates return with a "nothing changed" and are
useless*

So instead of hitting the server to death:

* create a cron timed job running every minute which polls the root of
the 30 repositories
* compares the revision to the previous run
* and only when something changed, calls `+svn log+`, retrieves SCM
information from the 20 team masters via this plugin and starts polling
individually.
