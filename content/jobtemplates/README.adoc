Allows you to create new jobs from templates.

This plugin provides a new link ("New Job From Template") in the
sidepanel of the Jenkins overview page, which leads you to another page
where you can set a name for the new job as well as choose from several
self-defined templates. (You can define these templates by creating jobs
with a name that starts with "Template_".) The new job then gets created
as a copy of the selected template.
