[[LabelLinkedJobsPlugin-Usage]]
== Usage

[[LabelLinkedJobsPlugin-Label'sLinkedJobspage.1]]
=== Label's Linked Jobs page

Activate the plugin in the Configure page from a label page
(/label/<your label>). A new Linked Jobs link will be shown in the
left-hand menu for that label. Use it to get to the Linked Jobs page.

In the Linked Jobs page you will see all jobs linked to this particular
label, either directly or via complex label expression. So let's say
you're on the Linked Jobs page of the "macos" label. You will see jobs
configured with "macos", those configured with "macos&&jdk7", those
configured with "jdk7 -> !macos", etc.

* jobs are grouped by their full label
* first group shown is always the atomic label of the Linked Jobs page
(if applicable, as no job may be using it as is)
* other groups are sorted alphabetically by the full label
* in each group, the nodes where the jobs could be running are listed.
There may be none, in that case you have to review your configuration
:-)
* there's a plugin option in the Jenkins Configuration System page that
can be unchecked to display a condensed view of the jobs groups (jobs
are just shown by name)
* if the Jenkins instance has at least one cloud defined, information
about the clouds (potentially) supporting each label is shown

[[LabelLinkedJobsPlugin-Node'sLinkedJobspage.2]]
=== Node's Linked Jobs page

A new link is available for Nodes in the left side menu: "Linked Jobs".
Following pieces of information are available on this new page:

* list of the labels assigned to this node
* Linked jobs section: list of all jobs that could run on this node,
based on label's configuration. Jobs are grouped by their full label
* Exclusive jobs: list of all jobs that can run only on this node, based
on label's configuration. Jobs are grouped by their full label. This
section can be deactivated in the plugin's settings

[[LabelLinkedJobsPlugin-LabelsDashboardpage]]
=== Labels Dashboard page

This global page, accessible from a new option in Jenkins root left-side
menu, is made of five sections.

* Labels
** this section lists all atomic labels used on this jenkins instance,
considering labels defined by all nodes (as well as clouds if
applicable) and labels used by all jobs, but not nodes' self-label (see
following section)
** each sub-section is an atomic label, with information about
*** how many jobs use it
*** how many nodes define it
*** if the Jenkins instance has at least one defined Cloud, how many
clouds can provision the label
* Nodes
** this section lists all nodes and indicates for each of them how many
jobs are using their self-label
* Orphaned Jobs
** This section lists all jobs that cannot run on any node, based on
label configuration. For instance:
*** a job configured with a label defined on no nodes
*** a job configured with a labels combination defining a condition that
no nodes meet
*** a job defining no labels, *and* all nodes on the jenkins instance
use the "Only build jobs with label restrictions matching this node"
usage option (`+hudson.model.Node.Mode.EXCLUSIVE+`)
* Single-node Jobs
** this section is optional and can be deactivated in the plugin's
settings
** this section lists all jobs that can run, based on label's
configuration, on only one node. This is useful to make sure that no
jobs will be unable to run in case a particular node goes down
** jobs are grouped by their "exclusive" node. To know more about the
label's configuration of these jobs, click on the node's link and go to
its "Linked Jobs" page to check its "Exclusive Jobs" section
* Label-less jobs
** this section is optional and can be deactivated in the plugin's
settings
** this section lists all jobs that have no labels defined (option
"Restrict where this project can be run" is not used)

[[LabelLinkedJobsPlugin-CompatibilitywithNodeLabelParameter&ParameterizedTriggerplugins]]
=== Compatibility with NodeLabel Parameter & Parameterized Trigger plugins

For more information and original discussion about this feature you can
refer to
https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-27588[JENKINS-27588].

In all pages described above, in addition to jobs that are configured
_directly_ with labels (via their *Restrict where this project can be
run* setting), the plugin pages list jobs that are configured with
labels using the
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/NodeLabel+Parameter+Plugin[NodeLabel
Parameter Plugin] settings and the
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Parameterized+Trigger+Plugin[Parameterized
Trigger Plugin] settings. There are two main situations:

* if a job uses the *This build is parameterized* setting and is
configured with a *Label* parameter (from the NodeLabel Parameter
plugin) with a Default Value, this default label is taken into account
by the Label Linked Jobs Plugin. Such jobs are listed in the appropriate
label section with the mention "This label is used by NN jobs as a
default value for their Label parameter" ; or "Job(s) using this label
as default value for a Label parameter:" (following by the list of these
jobs).
* if a job, in its *Trigger/call builds on other projects* sub-section
(in the *Build* section), triggers other jobs via a *Predefined
parameters*, or *All Nodes for Label Factory*, or *NodeLabel parameter*,
and makes use of labels in these sections, then the _triggered_ jobs are
taken into account in the Label Linked Jobs plugin pages. They are
listed with the mention "Triggered jobs (triggering job(s)):" followed
by a list of the triggered jobs, with the triggering job(s) indicated in
parenthesis.

There is an important *restriction* to this feature: for technical and
functional reasons, any label containing token or macro (with the
$\{TOKEN_NAME} syntax or with the $TOKEN_NAME syntax) is ignored.
