[[OpenEdgePlugin-Whatitdoes]]
== What it does

During a build, this plugin will:

* Export the DLC environment variable, pointing to the installed
OpenEdge tool
* Add the path `+$DLC/bin+` to the `+PATH+`, so that the tools are
available during the build

[[OpenEdgePlugin-Setup]]
== Setup

[[OpenEdgePlugin-Globalconfiguration]]
=== Global configuration

. In the tools settings (Manage Jenkins → Global Tool Configuration),
find the "OpenEdge Installations" section and click "Add OpenEdge".
. Enter a name, e.g. "OpenEdge 12.0" — the name itself has no
significance, but will be displayed to users during job configuration
. Type the installation directory (or leave it blank if OpenEdge is not
installed on the master server)

[[OpenEdgePlugin-Nodeconfiguration]]
=== Node configuration

. In the node settings (select node → Configuration), check "Tools
location" (if unchecked)
. Each OpenEdge installation configured globally can be overridden in
the slave

[[OpenEdgePlugin-Per-jobconfiguration]]
=== Per-job configuration

[[OpenEdgePlugin-Freestyle]]
==== Freestyle

. In a job's configuration, find the "Build environment" section
. Select the "Set up OpenEdge" checkbox
. Select the OpenEdge version you want to use when this job is built

[[OpenEdgePlugin-Pipeline]]
==== Pipeline

As with any other type of Tool Installer, you can use the `+tool+` step
to inject the DLC variable. For example:

[cols="<",]
|===
|`+// Run on an agent where we want to use OpenEdge+` +
`+node {+` +
`+    +``+// Define variable with OpenEdge 12.0 install location+` +
`+    +``+def root = tool name: +``+'OpenEdge 12.0'+``+, type: +``+'openedge'+` +
  +
`+    +``+// Or export DLC variable pointing to the directory where OE is installed+` +
`+    +``+withEnv(["DLC=${tool name: 'OpenEdge-12.0', type: 'openedge'}"+``+]) {+` +
`+        +``+sh +``+'echo $DLC'+` +
`+    +``+}+` +
`+}+`
