[[RequestRenameOrDeletePlugin-Aboutthisplugin]]
== About this plugin

This plugin adds two new actions on jobs' screen, so that users who
don't have the required permissions to rename and/or delete jobs can
request the Jenkins administrator to do so. +
The Jenkins administrator then gets a dedicated screen to handle all the
incoming requests.

== How does it work?

[[RequestRenameOrDeletePlugin-Forusers]]
=== For users

[[RequestRenameOrDeletePlugin-Renamingrequest]]
==== Renaming request

Users who have the configure permission but not the create and delete
ones can configure jobs but not rename them. With this plugin, they'll
get a new *Ask for renaming* action on their jobs:

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .image-center-wrapper]#image:docs/images/ask-renaming-01.png[image]#

When clicking on it, they'll be presented with a screen that allows
defining the new name for the job:

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .image-center-wrapper]#image:docs/images/ask-renaming-02.png[image]#

When clicking on the *Send request* button, a new item would appear in
the administrator's management screen (cf. below) for him to perform (or
not) the request.

[[RequestRenameOrDeletePlugin-Deletionrequest]]
==== Deletion request

Users who don't have the delete permission can't, of course, delete
jobs. The plugin offers for them a new *Ask for deletion* action on
their jobs:

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .image-center-wrapper]#image:docs/images/ask-deletion-01.png[image]#

When clicking on it, they'll be presented with a confirmation screen
and, if the request for deletion is confirmed, a new item would appear
in the administrator's management screen (cf. below) for him to perform
(or not) the request.

[[RequestRenameOrDeletePlugin-Foradministrators]]
=== For administrators

Administrators get a new *Pending renaming and deletion requests* entry
in Jenkins' main configuration screen (*Manage Jenkins* > *Configure
System*):

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .image-center-wrapper]#image:docs/images/admin-01.png[image]#

This offers a screen which centralizes all renaming and deletion
requests:

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .image-center-wrapper]#image:docs/images/admin-03.png[image]#

Administrators can then select a set of requests and apply or cancel
them.
