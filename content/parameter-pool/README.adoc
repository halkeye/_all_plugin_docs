Allows use of a unique parameter value per concurrent build

[[ParameterPoolPlugin-Configurationsteps]]
== Configuration steps

. Install plugin
. Add build step parameter pool to your project
. Project names refers to the projects that should be checked for
running parameter pool values. If left blank, only the project
containing the build step is checked.
. Paramter name is the name for the paramter
. Paramter pool is a comma separated list of parameter values that the
plugin can pick from.

[[ParameterPoolPlugin-Rulesforparameterselection]]
== Rules for parameter selection

* The plugin reads from left to right for parameter values.
* The first value that is not in a running build is picked.
* If prefer failed builds is selected, the first value that is from a
failed build and not in a running build is picked.
* [start..end] can be used for quick value entry. e.g. sanbox[1..5]
corresponds to sandbox1, sandbox2, sandbox3, sandbox4, sandbox5

[[ParameterPoolPlugin-Background]]
== *Background*

I needed to create something like this for our CI environment. We have
test VMs that we set up then run tests against on a per commit basis.

These VMs are separate to slaves. To run these tests concurrently, I
needed to ensure that two test jobs wouldn't run against the same test
VM.

Our development team use the following flow.

After a code commit, the following runs

. A container tests job is kicked off
. This job uses the parameter pool plugin to select a vm name that is
not in use in any other running container test job
. This vm is reverted
. This vm is rebuilt with the code from the commit
. Tests are run against that vm.
