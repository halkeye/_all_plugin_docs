This Jenkins post-build plugin allows you to execute tests in parallel
with the Microsoft Azure Batch service, and can reduce the duration of
your test runs, and therefore, potentially the cost.

Azure Batch enables you to run parallel applications efficiently in the

collection of virtual machines. You can find an introduction to the
Batch service in the
