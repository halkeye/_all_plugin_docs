This plugin acts like a coordinator that makes other jobs to build in a
particular sequence as pre-defined.

There are *serial* and *parallel* building patterns, which should have
already covered most scenarios.

[[Coordinator-Why?]]
== Why?

I've seen different organizations spending their own effort to customize
their CI tools, especially for job running dependency definitions.Â 

Say first run *Job A*, then *Job B* & *Job C* in parallel, then *Job D*,
then others, etc.

This plugin is meant to make this by drag & drop, and clicks. It would
be easy to trace the building histories including the person who
triggers the job,

build number, launch time, duration & status in each atomic job.

In a word, it's more like a dash board to keep all relevant information
in a page view.
