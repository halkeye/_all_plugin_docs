[[IRCPlugin-Features]]
== Features

See the 
http://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Instant+Messaging+Plugin[instant-messaging
plugin] for a description of protocol-independent features.

[[IRCPlugin-IRC-specificfeatures]]
=== IRC-specific features

* support password-protected chatrooms
* support NickServ authentication
* the rate at which messages are send is throttled to one every 500ms to
avoid being subject of flood control on the IRC server. +
This rate can be configured with the system
property hudson.plugins.ircbot.messageRate

[[IRCPlugin-Pipelinesyntaxfeatures]]
=== Pipeline syntax features

Starting with release 2.31 this plugin can be called as a pipeline step.
The same toggles as configurable in a legacy job post-build task can be
specified as named arguments to the pipeline step, with a difference
that they are executed at once.

[[IRCPlugin-Examplepipelinesteps]]
==== Example pipeline steps

Example `+ircNotify+` pipeline step syntax variants (not exhaustive): 

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
pipeline {
    agent any
    options {
        disableConcurrentBuilds()
        skipDefaultCheckout()
    }
    stages {
        stage ('Notify') {
            steps {
// Notify a start of build; appends the extra message at the end (note: prefix with separators if needed)
                ircNotify notifyOnStart:true, extraMessage: "Running IRCBot test..."
            }
        }

        stage ('PM') {
            steps {
// Post a verbatim custom message; can specify non-default targets (defaults are in global config)
                ircNotify targets: "jim #myroom", customMessage: "Hello from IRCBot"
            }
        }
    }
    post {
        always {
// Notify the verdict only known at end of build; send to default targets by default notification strategy
            ircNotify()
        }
    }
}
----

with an output in the IRC room like the following:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
(06:37:03) jenkins2: (notice) Starting build #214 for job GitOrg » reponame » branchname Running IRCBot test... (previous build: SUCCESS)
(06:37:04) jenkins2: (notice) Hello from IRCBot
(06:37:05) jenkins2: (notice) Project GitOrg » reponame » branchname build #214: SUCCESS in 7.2 sec: https://jenkins.localdomain/job/GitOrg/job/reponame/job/branchname/214/
----

[[IRCPlugin-Pipelinesteparguments]]
==== Pipeline step arguments

The `+ircNotify+`  step optionally accepts any of the following
parameters, and effectively passes them to the
http://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Instant+Messaging+Plugin[instant-messaging
plugin] for practical application.

[width="100%",cols="12%,13%,75%",options="header",]
|===
|argument name |syntax |description
|targets |space-separated string |Send the notification (or a
"customMessage") to specified user name(s) and channel name(s), the
latter start with a hash sign.

|notifyOnStart |boolean |[.pl-c]# Set to *true* explicitly in an
ircNotify step reporting a start of build, instead of a build
completion +
#

|notifySuspects |boolean |Select if the (build completion) notification
should alarm the c[.pl-c]##ommitters to (newly) failed builds##

|notifyCulprits |boolean |[.pl-c]#Specifies if culprits - i.e.
committers to previous already failing builds - should be informed about
subsequent build failures. +
#

|notifyFixers |boolean |[.pl-c]#Specifies if 'fixers' should be informed
about fixed builds. +
#

|notifyUpstreamCommitters |boolean |[.pl-c]#Specifies if upstream
committers should be informed about build failures. +
#

|extraMessage |string |[.pl-c]#Append an additional message to usual
notifications about build start/completion# (note: you may want to start
it with a separator like a semicolon)

|customMessage |string |[.pl-c]#*Instead* of build status messages, send
an arbitrary message to specified or default (global config) targets
with the pipeline step (and ignoring the strategy and filtering rules
options above) +
#
|===

The following options can be specified, but not sure to what effect and
how (TODO: try in practice and document here):

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
|argument name |syntax |description
|buildToChatNotifier |class name?
|https://github.com/jenkinsci/instant-messaging-plugin/blob/master/src/main/java/hudson/plugins/im/IMPublisher.java#L88

|notificationStrategy |string or java/groovy token? a|
https://github.com/jenkinsci/instant-messaging-plugin/blob/master/src/main/java/hudson/plugins/im/NotificationStrategy.java

* ALL - [.pl-c]#No matter what, notifications should always be sent.#
* [.pl-c]#[.pl-c1]#ANY_FAILURE# - Whenever there is a failure, a
notification should be sent. +
#
* [.pl-c]#[.pl-c1]#FAILURE_AND_FIXED# - Whenever there is a failure or a
failure was fixed, a notification should be sent. +
#
* [.pl-c]#[.pl-c1]#NEW_FAILURE_AND_FIXED# - Whenever there is a new
failure or a failure was fixed, a notification should be sent. Similar
to #FAILURE_AND_FIXED, but repeated failures do not trigger a
notification. +
#
* [.pl-c]#[.pl-c1]#STATECHANGE_ONLY - Notifications should be send only
if there was a change in the build state, or this was the first build. +
##

|matrixMultiplier |string or java/groovy token? a|
https://github.com/jenkinsci/instant-messaging-plugin/blob/master/src/main/java/hudson/plugins/im/IMPublisher.java#L89

=== Debugging Problems

If you experience any problems using the plugin please increase the log
level of the logger _hudson.plugins.ircbot_ to FINEST (see
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Logging[Logging]), try to
reproduce the problem and attach the collected logs to the JIRA issue.

[[IRCPlugin-Changelog]]
== Changelog

[[IRCPlugin-Version2.31(2019-08-09)]]
=== Version 2.31 (2019-08-09)

https://github.com/jenkinsci/ircbot-plugin/compare/ircbot-2.30...jenkinsci:ircbot-2.31

* Added a Jenkinsfile to CI-test the plugin itself:
https://github.com/jenkinsci/ircbot-plugin/pull/19
* Non-functional whitespace, javadoc and style fixes in the codebase for
better maintainability:
https://github.com/jenkinsci/ircbot-plugin/pull/20
* Added pipeline support to match capabilities of
instant-messaging-plugin release 1.36 (not fully published) and 1.37:
https://github.com/jenkinsci/ircbot-plugin/pull/21 and then 1.38:
https://github.com/jenkinsci/ircbot-plugin/pull/23 +
** So now there is an `+ircNotify()+` step with numerous supported
options (or default activity if none are passed) for `+Jenkinsfile+`
scripts!
* Added a `+customMessage+` option to instantly post the specified
message to specified IM target(s) as the payload of a step (not tied
into notification strategies for build start/completion): part of
https://github.com/jenkinsci/ircbot-plugin/pull/21
* Note that currently there is special syntax for build-start
notifications from a pipeline step (e.g.
`+ircNotify notifyOnStart:true+`) which is intended as a *temporary*
solution to the problem of not having support for an IM-specific
`+options{...}+` setting in pipelines yet, and so reporting "NOT BUILT"
(completion-notification mode) if there was no verdict yet

[[IRCPlugin-Version2.30(2017-08-25)]]

[[IRCPlugin-Usage]]
== Usage

When you install this plugin, your Hudson configuration page gets
additional "IRC Notification" option as illustrated below: +
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/hudson-irc.PNG[image]# +
  +
In addition, each project should add a "Post-build Actions"> "IRC
Notification" configuration as illustrated below: +
  +
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/hudson-irc-project.PNG[image]# +
  +
For the project configuration, leave the Channels blank to default to
the channels defined in the master IRC configration.
