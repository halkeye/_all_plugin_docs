[[FlexiblePublishPlugin-Features]]
== Features

* Use a publisher more than once within a build
* Select the execution order of the publishers
* Use
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Run+Condition+Plugin[Run
Conditions] to decide whether to publish
* Use Builders as actions by installing the
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Any+Build+Step+Plugin[Any
Build Step Plugin] (which will also install the
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Conditional+BuildStep+Plugin[Conditional
BuildStep Plugin])

Always use Always

[.aui-icon .aui-icon-small .aui-iconfont-approve .confluence-information-macro-icon]#
#

If you always add your Post-build Actions to Flexible publish, then not
only will you be able to change the execution order afterwards, but you
will have the ability to temporarily disable a publisher without losing
the publishers' configuration. +
You can just switch between the Always and the Never run conditions.

[[FlexiblePublishPlugin-Install]]
== Install

This plugin can be installed from the Update Center (Manage Jenkins >
Manage Plugins) under "Other Post-Build Actions".

To install manually, download the latest plugin from
http://mirrors.jenkins-ci.org/plugins/flexible-publish/ and use the
Upload Plugin option in the Advanced tab of the Plugin Manager. +
If you do install manually, you will need to also install the
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Run+Condition+Plugin[Run
Condition Plugin] from
http://mirrors.jenkins-ci.org/plugins/run-condition/ and the
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Token+Macro+Plugin[Token

[[FlexiblePublishPlugin-Importexistingpublishers]]
== Import existing publishers

In Manage Jenkins/ Script console, copy the following to see which
publishers can be moved (for a job named 'My Job')

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
import static org.jenkins_ci.plugins.flexible_publish.JobUpdater.*

def job = hudson.model.Hudson.instance.getItem('My Job')
list job
----

Or, if you like doing it the hard way ...

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
org.jenkins_ci.plugins.flexible_publish.JobUpdater.list(hudson.model.Hudson.instance.getItem('My Job'))
----

You should see a list something like this

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
Result: Enabled publishers that can be moved:
    [Publish Checkstyle analysis results]
    [Publish FindBugs analysis results]
    [Publish PMD analysis results]
    [Publish duplicate code analysis results]
    [Scan for compiler warnings]
    [Scan workspace for open tasks]
    [Publish combined analysis results]
    [Archive the artifacts]
    [Publish JUnit test result report]
    [Publish Javadoc]
    [Record fingerprints of files to track usage]
    [Git Publisher]
    [Send build artifacts over FTP]
    [Send build artifacts over SSH]
    [Send build artifacts to a windows share]

Enabled publishers that cannot be moved:
    [Aggregate downstream test results]
    [Build other projects]
    [Record Emma coverage report]
    [Report Violations]
    [E-mail Notification]
----

You can move a publisher into Flexible publish

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
import static org.jenkins_ci.plugins.flexible_publish.JobUpdater.*

def job = hudson.model.Hudson.instance.getItem('My Job')
movePublisher job, 'Publish JUnit test result report'
----

*After moving one or more publishers, go to the configure page, check
everything looks ok, then save the configuration.*

If you like to live on the edge, and would like to move all of the
publishers in one go, then ...

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
import static org.jenkins_ci.plugins.flexible_publish.JobUpdater.*

def job = hudson.model.Hudson.instance.getItem('My Job')
moveAllPublishers job
----

[[FlexiblePublishPlugin-Usedwithmulti-configurationprojects]]
== Used with multi-configuration projects

When you use Flexible Publish Plugin with multi-configuration projects
(aka. matrix projects), you should know followings:

Generally, publishers run in two phase for multi-configuration projects.

. Run for each combination of axes. It works just like in Free Style
Projects.
. Run for whole the multi-configuration project. This is what is called
aggregation.

For example, "Publish JUnit test result report" works:

. see test results in each combination of axes
. sum up the results of all of the combinations.

You can specify conditions both for each combination and the
aggregation. +
If you want to separate condition for them, check "Condition for Matrix
Aggregation" (This appears only in multi-configuration projects). +
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/matrixaggregation.png[image]#

This is especially useful for the case you want control the execution of
the publisher depends on combination of axes. +
Be careful to specify the condition, for inconsistent execution causes
the build fails.

[[FlexiblePublishPlugin-Howflexiblepublishworkswhenapublisherfails]]
== How flexible publish works when a publisher fails

* Available since flexible-publish-0.15.
* You can specify "Execution Strategy" with which flexible publish
decides how to work when a publisher fails.
+
[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Execution Strategy |Behavior on a failure of a publisher
|Fail at end |Continues to run following publishers. The default
behavior in flexible-publish 0.15 and later.

|Fail fast |Doesn't run following publishers. The default behavior for
flexible-publish configured in 0.13 and 0.14.1.
|===
* This works as followings:
** Example configuration
+
....
Flexible Publish
    Condition 1
        Publisher 1
        Publisher 2
    Condition 2
        Publisher 3
....
** When Publisher 1 fails, following publishers are handled as:
+
[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
|Execution Strategy for Condition 1 |Publisher 2 |Publisher 3
|Fail at end |Performed |Performed
|Fail fast |Not performed |Performed
|===
*** Following conditions are always performed even prior publishers
failed.
*** Following publishers in a same condition is performed when the
execution strategy is "Fail at end".

[[FlexiblePublishPlugin-Limitations]]
== Limitations

[[FlexiblePublishPlugin-SomepublishersmaynotworkwithFlexiblePublish.]]
=== Some publishers may not work with Flexible Publish.

* Some publishers *may* not be prepared to run more than once during a
build
* Some publishers need to find themselves configured in the projects,
but fail to do that when included in Flexible Publish.

[[FlexiblePublishPlugin-Sidelinksareduplicated]]
=== Side links are duplicated

* Some publishers display side links in project status pages and build
status pages.
* Configuring multiple publishers of a same kind results duplicated side
links like this (this is a case with
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Email-ext+plugin[Email-ext
plugin]): +
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .image-center-wrapper]#image:docs/images/duplicated-sidelink.png[image]#
* There's no proper and general way to fix this, and this isn't planned
to be fixed as it's harmless.

[[FlexiblePublishPlugin-Whynamed"FlexiblePublish"?]]
== Why named "Flexible Publish" ?

* It's often accused that "Flexible Publish plugin should have been
named Conditional Publisher plugin"
* You couldn't reorder publishers with old Jenkins (Jenkins < 1.463).
Also see
https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#\!topic/jenkinsci-dev/UQLvxQclyb4
* A feature to reorder publishers was as important as a feature to
launch publishers conditionally. So named "Flexible Publish".
