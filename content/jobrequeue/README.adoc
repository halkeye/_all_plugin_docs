A plugin to requeue any jobs that fail due to the remote slave going
down.

[[JobRequeue-Plugin-Description]]
== Description

If the server/slave that the job is running on fails for any reason, the
job will be added to the queue again to ensure that it is run. +
The original job will still appear to have failed, but the job will be
run again when a slave is available for processing. +
This plugin is very useful if the up time of your slaves are not
guaranteed or even otherwise unreliable.
