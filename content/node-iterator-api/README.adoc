== Node Iterator API Plugin

This plugin provides support for iterating through all the Node
instances that are in use by Jenkins, even those Node instances that are
not traditionally attached to Jenkins. The API exposed by this plugin
can be used by cloud provider plugins to identify unused provisioned
resource.
