Most critical issues found with Bitbucket pullrequest builder pluginÂ is
no control in triggering builds by open pull requests. When the plugin
is initially installed & configured, all open pull requests will be
triggered, which might crash the system when there are many open PRs.
Besides, whenever a user creates a PR or commits a change, the build
will be triggered, causing massive unnecessary build processes and
failures. Users like to control the triggering of builds when it's
ready.

Suggestion: add a checkbox like below
