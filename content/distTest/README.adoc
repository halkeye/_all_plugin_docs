This plugin allows distribute JUnit tests to all slaves in a specified
label for a project.

[[DistTestPlugin-DistributedTestingPlugin]]
== Distributed Testing Plugin

The goal of this plugin is to enable a distributed testing of compiled
classes on multiple nodes. Tests are send one by one to nodes in the
label specified for the project and run. Test results +
are saved in the "results" directory in the project workspace. f.e.
"TEST-helloword.HelloTest.xml" for the test class
"helloworld.HelloTest".

*This plugin assumes that all slaves in the specified label have a
shared workspace directory. (like NFS)*

Only classes in the "Tests classes directory" directory with a file name
containing a "test" substring (case insensitive) are automatically found
by this plugin and run.

If you enable "Publish JUnit test result report" in the "Post-build
Actions" section and type "results/*.xml" you will see test results in
the Hudson's web UI.

Only nodes in a label which were specified for this project ("Tie this
project to a node") will be used for distributed testing.

It's possible let this plugin to compile tests class sources which were
checkout from a repository if "Compile tests" checkbox was checked.
Remember to provide all necessary libraries needed for compilation.

It's possible to check a "Wait for nodes which are busy" checkbox to
wait for other nodes which are busy to be freed.
