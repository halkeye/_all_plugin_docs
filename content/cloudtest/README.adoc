The CloudTest Jenkins plugin provides the ability to

* Easily run the MakeAppTouchTestable utility on an iOS or Android
project
* Silently install an iOS app on a connected device
* Play CloudTest compositions and include the output in the build's test
results
* Launch and tear down grids, results databases, and test environments.

[[SOASTACloudTestPlugin-Prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

The CloudTest plug-in requires Jenkins 1.580.1 or later.

[[SOASTACloudTestPlugin-GlobalConfigurationOptions]]
== Global Configuration Options

Before using the plug-in, you will need to provide the CloudTest server
information, in the "Manage Jenkins" -> "Configure System" page. This
includes the CloudTest URL and a set of credentials. _We recommend
creating a dedicated CloudTest account for Jenkins to use._

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/Configure_System_Screen_Shot.png[image]#

The CloudTest password is encrypted before saving it to disk. It is also
masked (e.g. "****") in all output generated during builds.

[[SOASTACloudTestPlugin-BuildSteps]]
== Build Steps

The plug-in adds the following new build steps:

[[SOASTACloudTestPlugin-MakeAppTouchTestable]]
=== Make App TouchTestable

Adds the TouchTest Driver library to your app's source code. Typically
this build step is inserted right before the build step that compiles
the app's code (e.g. before the Xcode build step for iOS, or before the
"Invoke Ant" build step for Android).

[[SOASTACloudTestPlugin-InstalliOSApponDevice]]
=== Install iOS App on Device

Silently installs an IPA file on one or more attached iOS devices. This
ensures that your tests run against the latest version of your app.

*Note*: there is no Android version of this build step, because the
Android SDK already provides this functionality ("adb install").

[[SOASTACloudTestPlugin-PlayComposition]]
=== Play Composition

Executes a CloudTest composition, and saves the output in the build's
test results. You can include this build step multiple times if there
are multiple compositions in your test suite.

[[SOASTACloudTestPlugin-StartGrid]]
=== Start Grid

Starts the grid with the specified CloudTest server, and name, and
ensures that the object reaches a ready status. In the event that the
grid fails to reach a ready status, it will be torn down and the build
step will fail.

[[SOASTACloudTestPlugin-StopGrid]]
=== Stop Grid

Terminates the grid, and ensures that the grid reaches a terminated
status. In the event that the grid fails to reach a terminated status,
the build step will fail.

[[SOASTACloudTestPlugin-StartRSDB]]
=== Start RSDB

Starts the RSDB with the specified CloudTest server, and name, and
ensures that the RSDB reaches a ready status. In the event that the RSDB
fails to reach a ready status, it will be torn down and the build step
will fail.

[[SOASTACloudTestPlugin-StopRSDB]]
=== Stop RSDB

Terminates the RSDB, and ensures that the RSDB reaches a terminated
status. In the event that the grid fails to reach a terminated status,
the build step will fail.

[[SOASTACloudTestPlugin-TestEnvironments]]
=== Test Environments

Note that for test environments you will need to set up a CloudTest
Server to point to CloudTest Manager
https://cloudtestmanager.soasta.com/concerto/.

[[SOASTACloudTestPlugin-StartTestEnvironment]]
=== Start Test Environment

Starts the test environment with the specified CloudTest server (Note
this MUST be CTM), and name, and ensures that the object reaches a ready
status. In the event that the test environment fails to reach a ready
status, it will be torn down and the build step will fail.

[[SOASTACloudTestPlugin-StopTestEnvironment]]
=== Stop Test Environment

Terminates the test environment, and ensures that the test environment
reaches a terminated status. In the event that the test environment
fails to reach a terminated status, the build step will fail.

[[SOASTACloudTestPlugin-WakeUpiOSDevice]]
=== Wake Up iOS Device

Wakes up one or more attached iOS devices, and opens Mobile Safari to
the most recently-viewed page (e.g. TouchTest Agent). This can
optionally be used at the beginning of a build, to "prep" the devices
for testing.

*Note:* There is no Android version of this build step, because the
Android SDK already provides this functionality.

[[SOASTACloudTestPlugin-RebootiOSDevice]]
=== Reboot iOS Device

Reboots one or more attached iOS devices. This can optionally be used at
the end of a build, to "reset" for the next one.

*Note*: There is no Android version of this build step, because the
Android SDK already provides this functionality ("adb reboot").
