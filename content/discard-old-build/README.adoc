This plugin provides a post-build step where you can discard old build
results in detailed configuration (ex. keep only builds with specified
status).

[[DiscardOldBuildplugin-Summary]]
== Summary

* You can configure how to discard builds in more detail than the
default 'Discard Old Build' function.
** Other than # of builds and days, you can specify build status to
discard/keep.
** For older builds, you can configure interval to keep builds (once in
a month, once in ten builds...).
** You can also use logfile size to decide if delete a old build.

[[DiscardOldBuildplugin-Usage]]
== Usage

[[DiscardOldBuildplugin-Basic]]
=== Basic

After installing this plugin, a new post-build step named 'Discard Old
Builds' appears.

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .image-center-wrapper]#image:docs/images/discardOldBuild_conf1.png[image]#

'Days to keep builds' and 'Max # of builds to keep' work as same as
Jenkins core function. +
With checking statuses in 'Status to keep' section, Jenkins will keep
the builds with selected statuses.

* Last build / last stable build / last successful build are always
kept.
* If all the checkboxes are left unchecked, builds with any status are
kept.

[[DiscardOldBuildplugin-Advanced]]
=== Advanced

In advanced section, you can configure how to treat the builds which are
older than the criteria specified in basic configuration. +
For old builds, perhaps you don't want to keep all, but sometimes you
want to keep some of them with less frequency.
