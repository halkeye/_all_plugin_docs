[[EnvironmentManagerPlugin-Introduction]]
== Introduction

The Parasoft Environment Manager plugin for Jenkins lets you rapidly
configure various actions needed for automated, continuous testing
across your software delivery pipeline. You can configure build steps
for:

* Provisioning environments into the specific states needed for
automated testing
* Replicating environments and associated assets to different Virtualize
servers, including servers dynamically-provisioned from Docker or other
container technologies
* Executing Parasoft test scenario jobs (tests suites that execute vs.
specific environment configurations)
* Destroying "dirtied" test environments to ensure that subsequent tests
always begin with a clean slate
* Disconnecting a Virtualize server from Environment Manager to remove
unnecessary connections
