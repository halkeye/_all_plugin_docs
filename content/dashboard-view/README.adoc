following warnings before using an older version:

XSS vulnerability]

This plugin contributes a new view implementation that provides a
dashboard / portal-like view for your Jenkins instance.

[[DashboardView-Addnewview]]
== Add new view

On the Jenkins main page, click the + tab to start the new view wizard
(If you do not see a +, it is likely you do not have permission to
create a new view).  On the create new view page, give your view a name
and select the Dashboard type and click ok.  
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/create-view.PNG[image]#

[[DashboardView-Configuredashboardview]]
== Configure dashboard view

The configuration is done in 2 parts, selecting the Jenkins jobs to
include in the view, and selecting which dashboard portlets to have
included in the view.  The jobs that you select are used for all the
portlets to draw their information from.
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/dashboard-view-configure-1.jpg[image]#

[[DashboardView-Selectjobs]]
=== Select jobs

Select the list of jobs to include in the dashboard. This is exactly the
same process as the standard list view that comes with Jenkins.

Also a regular expression can be used to specify the jobs to include in
the view.

[[DashboardView-Options]]
=== Options

* Show standard Jenkins list at the top of the page: shows uses standard
Jenkins jobs list as it would be when using Jenkins' built-in  'List
View' type.

[[DashboardView-Selectportlets]]
=== Select portlets

Configure which portlets you want to see on the top and on the left and
the right column.  Each portlet may have its own configuration but at a
minimum it requires a name to be given to it. +
Click ok and the dashboard configuration will be saved and you will be
brought to the dashboard view itself.

[[DashboardView-Viewlayout]]
== View layout

The dashboard view supports a layout with rows spanning the entire view
with 2 columns.

Top portlet 1

Left portlet 1

Right portlet 1

Left portlet 2

Right portlet 2

Bottom portlet 1

[[DashboardView-Coreportlets]]
== Core portlets

The dashboard view comes with a number of portlets that you can
configure your view with (New portlets can be contributed to Jenkins via
other plugins, even your own).

[[DashboardView-StandardJenkinsjobslist]]
=== Standard Jenkins jobs list

This portlet shows a row for each job showing the standard columns
configured in Jenkins. All the configured portlets are displayed below
this list. +
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/dashboard-view-ShowStdJobListAtTop.jpg[image]#

[[DashboardView-JobsGrid]]
=== Jobs Grid

The jobs grid portlet displays a 3 column table with the current status
and a clickable link to the job.  This offers a more compressed
presentation of your jobs than the standard 1 row per job view, albeit
at the cost of some job information.
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/all-jobs.PNG[image]#

[[DashboardView-UnstableJobs]]
=== Unstable Jobs

This portlet lists the unstable jobs within the view.  Note, this does
not necessarily list all of Jenkins' unstable jobs, but only looks at
jobs configured for this view.
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/unstable-jobs.PNG[image]#

[[DashboardView-TestStatisticsGrid]]
=== Test Statistics Grid

The test statistics grid shows detailed test data for the configured
jobs.  This is useful to get an aggregated count of tests across the
jobs in your view.   If desired, jobs with zero tests can be hidden.
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/test-stats-grid.PNG[image]#

[[DashboardView-TestStatisticsChart]]
=== Test Statistics Chart

This is a pie chart of the tests in the configured jobs.  It shows the
passing, failing, and skipped jobs with the total # and percentages.

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/test-stats-chart.PNG[image]#

[[DashboardView-TestTrendChart]]
=== Test Trend Chart

This is a chart that shows your tests over time in aggregate.  The logic
is that for every day since the first job in the view was built, it
shows the total number of passing, skipped and failing tests in
aggregate across the build.  It assumes that if a build did not occur on
a given day, that the previous day's build results (or the
previous-previous day, etc.) will be used.
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/test-trends.PNG[image]#

[[DashboardView-Jobsstatistics]]
=== Jobs statistics

Shows statistics based on jobs health.

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/dashboard-view-JobsStatistics.JPG[image]#

[[DashboardView-Buildstatistics]]
=== Build statistics

Shows statistics based on build status.

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/dashboard-view-BuildStatistics.JPG[image]#

[[DashboardView-ExtendingtheDashboardViewplugin]]
== Extending the Dashboard View plugin

Much of the benefit of this plugin will be realized when other plugins
that enhance Jenkins offer support for it.

Add support in your plugin:

* Extend the DashboardPortlet class and provide a descriptor that
extends the Descriptor<DashboardPortlet>
* Create a jelly view called portlet.jelly
* Optionally create a jelly view called main.jelly to be used when the
portlet is in maximized mode (otherwise the same portlet.jelly view will
be used)

It is possible to define custom parameters for the DashboardPortlet. The
displayName is always required. To add new parameters:

* create a jelly file called config.jelly to be used when the portlet is
configured (added to the view in 'Edit View' config page);
* modify constructor (with @DataBoundConstructor) to receive the new
parameters.

Looking at the source code of this plugin will show a number of examples
of doing this. The core portlets do the same thing that your plugin
would do.

On your plugin Wiki page, add the label supports-dashboard-view so that
it will show up in the list below.

Sample files:

*MyPortlet.java*

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
import hudson.plugins.view.dashboard.DashboardPortlet;

class MyPortlet extends DashboardPortlet {

    @DataBoundConstructor
    public MyPortlet(String name) {
        super(name);
    }

// do whatever you want

    @Extension
    public static class DescriptorImpl extends Descriptor<DashboardPortlet> {
        @Override
        public String getDisplayName() {
            return "MyPortlet";
        }
    }
};
----

*portlet.jelly*

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
<j:jelly xmlns:j="jelly:core" xmlns:st="jelly:stapler" xmlns:d="jelly:define" xmlns:dp="/hudson/plugins/view/dashboard" xmlns:l="/lib/layout" xmlns:t="/lib/hudson" xmlns:f="/lib/form">

  <dp:decorate portlet="${it}"> <!-- This is to say that this is a dashboard view portlet -->
    <tr><td> <!-- This is needed because everything is formatted as a table - ugly, I know -->

      <!-- you can include a separate file with the logic to display your data or you can write here directly -->
      <div align="center">
        <st:include page="myportlet.jelly"/>
       </div>

     </td></tr>
  </dp:decorate>
</j:jelly>
