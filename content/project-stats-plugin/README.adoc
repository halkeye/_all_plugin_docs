Jenkins uses lazy loading of build records since version 1.485, and
Project Statistics Plugin requires all builds to be loaded every time it
counts them. Depending on the number of builds and amount of memory you
have, this may result in constant loading/discarding of build records
and bad UI performance.

This plugin provides new dashboard-view portlets and new columns for
displaying project statistics for your Jenkins instance.

on the mailing list] I created a new plugin that provides statistics for
each project (versus global statistics that are already provided by the
dashboard view plugin and several others).
