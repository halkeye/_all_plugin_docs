== Basic usage

[[DebianPackageBuilderPlugin-Components]]
=== Components

Installing this plugin contributes following:

* *Build debian package* build step
* *Publish debian packages* post-build step
* *Debian package builder* section in the global configuration
* *Debian package publisher* section in the global configuration

[[DebianPackageBuilderPlugin-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

The plugin uses global GPG key to build and sign .deb packages. It is
configured in the *Debian package builder* section of the global
configuration. The parameter names are pretty much self-descriptive:

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/DPB.png[image]#

*Debian package publisher* section configures available debian
repositories to publish packages to:

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/DPP.png[image]#

The *Advanced* section configures SSH key to be used with SCPB method
and extra SSH options (like -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no)

[[DebianPackageBuilderPlugin-Building]]
=== Building

The *Build debian package* step has a main configuration parameter "Path
to 'debian' catalog" that should point to a catalog that contains
*debian* catalog.

For example, if checkout has structure like
*$WORKSPACE/myproject/util/debian/* you should use *myproject/util* as a
configuration value.

By default, the build step will install all the requirements on its own,
use *pbuilder-satisfy-depends* to install build-deps of a package and
then use *debuild* to actually build package.

The package *.deb* will be added as a build artifact and badge with a
version per backage built will be applied to the build:

[[DebianPackageBuilderPlugin-Publishing]]
=== Publishing

The *Publish debian packages* post-build step uses *debrealease* to
publish package and according .changes to the selected repository. The
*dupload.conf* will be automatically generated with configured GPG
account data and used keys.

[[DebianPackageBuilderPlugin-Automaticversionmanipulation]]
=== Automatic version manipulation

Plugin is capable of automatically starting new package version upon
build, recording recent changes and commiting it back to SCM.

However, the only supported SCM so far is Subversion due to the absence
of commit capabilities in Jenkins SCM core classes.

To use it, check the "Generate changelog" box on the build step and
"Commit changes back to repository" on the post-build step.

Upon build, it will:

* start a new version, increasing last numeric component of version by 1
– i.e. version *1.2.8* will become *1.2.9*;
* if SCM is SVN, append revision number to the version number in form of
'1.2.r12345', where 12345 is the revision;
* record all the changes – from SVN revision history, starting from last
recorded revision, or from Jenkins build history – to *debian/changelog*
of a new version via *dch*;

To better handle failed builds, use 'Checkout fresh copy' SVN option (or
similar for other SCM).

[[DebianPackageBuilderPlugin-Spacesinpath]]
=== Spaces in path

In versions prior to 1.3 there were issues with spaces in path, causing
all kinds of errors. Problems in the plugin itself are fixed, however
there are certain troubles in the debian build systems themselves,
namely CDBS. See this issue on debian.org:
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=306941.
