* Trigger Codefresh pipeline execution from your freestyle Jenkins jobs:
** 'Add Build Step' -> 'Run Codefresh Pipeline'
** By default - this will trigger the pipeline that corresponds to the
git repo defined in the job's SCM configuration.
** If there's no SCM defined for current job or you would like to
trigger a different service pipeline - check the '_Choose service to
build_' option. This will present you with drop-down selectable list of
all your defined Codefresh pipelines.
** Check the 'Set Codefresh Pipeline Variables' option to pass
environment variables to the pipeline execution.

Once configured - the plugin will trigger Codefresh, run your tests and
report the results. On job completion a Codefresh badge will appear next
to the build execution. Clicking on it will take you to the build
results page on Codefresh:
