When you want to notify a build result, you can use 'typetalkSend' step
with 'catchError'.

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
node {
    catchError {
        sh 'might fail'
    }
    typetalkSend name: 'ikikko test', topicId: 9260
}
----

You can also notify an event whichÂ starts and/or ends with
'withTypetalk' step.

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
withTypetalk(name: 'ikikko test', notifyEnd: true, notifyEndMessage: '', notifyStart: true, notifyStartMessage: '', topicId: 9260) {
    // some block
}
----

Notification URL

In order to operate Jenkins from Typetalk, you should set a certain
endpoint to Typetalk bot in a topic.

[[TypetalkPlugin-BotforallJenkinsprojects]]
==== Bot for all Jenkins projects

This plugin provides the following endpoint to receive message from
Typetalk. You have to set it to a webhook URL of Typetalk bot. See
http://developer.nulab-inc.com/docs/typetalk/webhook[the official
document] for more.

....
http://<Jenkins URL>/typetalk/notify
....

Then, you can operate Jenkins by mentioning to the bot as follows:

....
@jenkins+ build <project> (<key=value>)
@jenkins+ list (<regexp filter>)
@jenkins+ help (<sub command>)
....

In this case, @jenkins+ is your bot name here.

[[TypetalkPlugin-BotforasingleJenkinsproject]]
==== Bot for a single Jenkins project

By adding project name as a parameter of webhook URL,

....
http://<Jenkins URL>/typetalk/notify?project=<project>
....

then you can omit the name when mentioning to Typetalk bot like this.

....
@jenkins-project+
@jenkins-project+ build (<key=value>)
....
