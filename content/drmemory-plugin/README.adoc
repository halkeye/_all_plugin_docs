 This plugin can monitor memory related programming errors using the
http://www.drmemory.org/[Dr. Memory] application. 

[[drmemoryplugin-Setup]]
== Setup

This plugin is divided into two sections:

. A build step
. A post build step

[[drmemoryplugin-Buildstep]]
=== Build step

First a build step must be set up, providing information about the
executable to be executed with Dr. Memory. This path is relative to the
Jenkins workspace. This can, for example, be some output executable from
a previous build step.

Secondly, arguments of the executable can be provided. The log path is
where Dr. Memory puts its log files, needed by the post build step.

[[drmemoryplugin-Postbuildstep]]
=== Post build step

In the post build step, the processing of the Dr. Memory log files are
processed.

It is also possible to enable graphs, visualizing the progress.

Currently graphs visualizing

* Total leaks
* Possible leaks
* Bytes of leak
* Uninitialized accesses
* Invalid heap arguments
* Warnings
* Still reachable allocations
* Unaddressable accesses

are available.
