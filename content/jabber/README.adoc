[.conf-macro .output-inline]##Integrates Jenkins with the Jabber/XMPP
instant messaging protocol. Note that you also need to install the
http://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Instant+Messaging+Plugin[instant-messaging
plugin].##This plugin enables Jenkins to send build notifications via
Jabber, as well as let users talk to Jenkins via a 'bot' to run
commands, query build status etc..

[[JabberPlugin-Userauthenticateduserforthecommand'bot']]
== User authenticated user for the command 'bot'

If you have a secure Jenkins that does not allow anonymous user to
build, you will need to have a user for Jabber. !build command can give
an error as discussed in
https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-15897[JENKINS-15897].  As
of version 1.35, the error is misleading as Jenkins complains about the
command syntax instead of unauthorized access error.

Adding a dedicated authenticated user for the bot could fix this
problem:

* Add a new Jenkins user (will assume the username is _notification_)
* If using _Matrix-based security_ (Manage Jenkins -> Configure Global
Security)_,_ add permission for the _notification_ user for Job build,
cancel, discover and read
* Create a new global credentials and set the password for the user
_notification_
* In Jabber Plugin Configuration, set the Jenkins username to
_notification_

[[JabberPlugin-DebuggingProblems]]
== Debugging Problems

If you experience any problems using the plugin please increase the log
level of the logger _hudson.plugins.jabber_ to FINEST (see
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Logging[Logging] ), try to
reproduce the problem and attach the collected logs to the JIRA issue.
