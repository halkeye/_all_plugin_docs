Enhanced Old Build Discarder is a Jenkins plugin that extends the
functionality of the internal build discard plugin with an option to
prevent discard of builds when the job is unstable, in addition to the
ability to require both age and quantity conditions be met prior to
build discard.

The plugin is configured as a build rotation
strategy labelled __Enhanced Log Rotator __in the internal _Discard old
builds_ feature. It can additionally be configured as a Pipeline script
using a call to properties() such as:

....
properties([[$class: 'BuildDiscarderProperty', strategy: [$class: 'EnhancedOldBuildDiscarder',
 artifactDaysToKeepStr: '', artifactNumToKeepStr: '', daysToKeepStr: '10', numToKeepStr: '10',
 discardOnlyOnSuccess: false, holdMaxBuilds: true]]]);
....
