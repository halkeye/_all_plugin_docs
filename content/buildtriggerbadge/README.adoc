This plugin displays icon(s) representing the cause(s) of a build
directly in the build history. It lets you quickly know which cause
triggered a build.Without this plugin, you may sometimes wonder what
triggered a particular build shown in the build history. +
To know it, you have to open each link separately, which can be
cumbersome.

Note: after installation, the plugin will currently only add icons on
new builds. Old builds won't have the indicator.

[[BuildTriggerBadgePlugin-Wait,thisdoesnotwork,Iseeaquestionmarkiconformybuilds!]]
== Wait, this does not work, I see a question mark icon for my builds!

This means the _cause_ of the build is not yet supported by the plugin.
It's pretty easy to add one, we basically only need the fully qualified
name (FQN) of that build cause, and an icon
image:docs/images/smile.svg[(smile)]. +
Finding out that FQN is pretty easy. You can simply use the Jenkins API
through your browser.

Open the build page, and suffix it with
_/api/xml?xpath=//cause&wrapper=causes_. To give something like:
_https://yourjenkinsserver/job/somejob/15/api/xml?xpath=//cause&wrapper=causes_

Then, paste that output in a JIRA issue explaining your case. Even
better, filing a pull-request would be great

#

To remove duplicates of the same Cause type and the same description
(see https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-15474[JENKINS-15474]),
you can apply this groovy script :

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
import org.jenkinsci.plugins.buildtriggerbadge.BuildTriggerBadgeAction;

for(item in Jenkins.instance.items) {
  for(build in item.builds) {
    def set = new HashSet();
    for(action in build.badgeActions) {
      if(action instanceof BuildTriggerBadgeAction) {
        def filter = action.cause.class.canonicalName + "_" + action.cause.shortDescription
        if(set.contains(filter)) {
        println "removing duplicates BuildTriggerBadgeAction in build " + build.id
            build.actions.remove(action)
            build.save()
        }
        else {
            set.add(filter);
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

It's not necessary to apply this script for versions >= 0.9.
