[.conf-macro .output-inline]#This plugin allows Jenkins to invoke
http://rake.rubyforge.org/[Rake] tasks as build steps.# +
The plugin detects the ruby VM installed on the host and it allows you
to include new instances. You can configure Jenkins to allow that each
project will select the installation that will use.

This plugin works as other builders like Ant builder or Gant builder.
You just need to specify the Rake tasks to run but you can also
configure other Rake options.

[[Rakeplugin-Rvmintegration]]
== Rvm integration

Since version 1.7 the Rake plugin also detects the machine's Rvm
installation and collects its Ruby instances to use them as normal
instances:

If your Rvm installation is not in the default directory, $HOME/.rvm,
the path can be modified into the Jenkins' system configuration panel:
