This plugin deploys applications (WAR or EAR files) to a WildFly or
JBoss EAP server or server group.

[[WildFlyDeployerPlugin-Description]]
== Description

[[WildFlyDeployerPlugin-Features]]
=== Features

* Deploys an application to a WildFly/JBoss server or server group.
* A single WAR or EAR file must exist in the workspace on the slave
where the project is run.
* If the application already exists in the server or server group, it is
uninstalled first.
* The WildFly/JBoss server or domain controller can be local or remote
to the slave where the project is run.
* This plugin works with WildFly 8 and JBoss EAP 7 and later versions.

[[WildFlyDeployerPlugin-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Due to classloading behaviour in the WildFly CLI libraries, the Jenkins
WAR file must be re-assembled (or the expanded Jenkins application
modified) with the following changes.

* Copy wildfly-cli-8.2.1.Final.jar to /WEB-INF/lib.
* If using Jenkins version 1.622 or earlier, copy
log4j-over-slf4j-1.7.7.jar to /WEB-INF/lib, and remove
theÂ log4j-1.2.*.jar from /WEB-INF/lib.
