This plugin provides a very basic build step for projects which use
CocoaPods.

This adds a "Update CocoaPods" build step, which runs
`+pod repo update+` and then `+pod install+` in the root of your
workspace. +
Optionally, by checking the `+Clean "Pods" folder+` option, the `+Pods+`
folder will first be deleted.

Note: there currently isn't any advantage to installing this plugin,
compared to using an "Execute shell" step to run these commands
yourself.
