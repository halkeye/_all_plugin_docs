[.conf-macro .output-inline]#With this plugin you can add a build step
to your Jenkins project that executes a http://copa.do/[Copado]
http://docs.copado.apiary.io/[Webhook API] task. You would add this step
after your Copado setup is finished. After the Copado Webhook is
triggered, the plugin will wait for the job run to finish (or timeout).
If the Job step is successful, your pipeline will continue to the next
step in your pipeline; however, if it fails (or times out), the build
will be marked as failed.#
