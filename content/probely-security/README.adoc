[[ProbelySecurityScannerPlugin-Description]]
== Description

This plugin uses https://probely.com/[Probely] to scan your web
application for security vulnerabilities. It enables security testing in
your CI/CD pipeline.

Probely is a Web Vulnerability Scanning suite for Agile Teams. It
provides continuous scanning of your Web Applications and lets you
efficiently manage the lifecycle of the vulnerabilities found. Some of
its main features are:

* Tests for more than 5000 vulnerabilities
* Authenticated scanning
* Tailored instructions on how to fix the vulnerabilities (including
snippets of code)
* API for every single feature
* Jira and Slack integration
* PCI-DSS and OWASP compliance reports
* Designed for developers, easy to use, easy to understand.
* Re-test vulnerabilities, define custom headers, multiple users, CVSS
score, scheduling, and more.

[[ProbelySecurityScannerPlugin-Installingtheplugin]]
== Installing the plugin

Installing and setting up the plugin will take you less than 5 minutes.

. Open Jenkins and click on *Manage Jenkins*
. Click on *Manage Plugins*
. Click on the *Available* tab
. On the Filter search box, enter *probely*
. Select the *Probely Security Scanner* plugin
. Click on *Download now and install after restart*
. After Jenkins restarts, the plugin will be installed. Continue reading
to setup the required Probely API key.

[[ProbelySecurityScannerPlugin-GeneratinganAPIkey]]
== Generating an API key

Before using the plugin, you first need to create an API key for Jenkins
to be able to start a scan with Probely.

. Go to https://app.probely.com/[https://app.probely.com] and log in
. Select a target from the drop-down list
. Go to the *Settings* page
. Click on the *Integrations* tab
. Write a name for the API Key. Since we want this API Key for Jenkins,
we name it *Jenkins*
. Click on *Generate New Key*

an API key,width=875]#]

After the API key is created, please take note of the *Target id* and
**API key **values. They will be required to configure the Plugin
credentials later on.

[[ProbelySecurityScannerPlugin-Configuringtheplugin]]
== Configuring the plugin

The plugin can be used both in a Freestyle or a in a Pipeline project.
We will describe how to use the plugin in both project types.

[[ProbelySecurityScannerPlugin-Configuringcredentials]]
=== Configuring credentials

. Click on *Credentials*
. Click on the *down arrow* near (global) to enable the dropdown menu
and choose *Add credentials*

Credentials,width=875]#]

. On the *Kind* dropdown menu, choose *Secret text*
. Enter the API key in the *Secret* textbox
. Enter a value for the credentials in the *ID* textbox, for
example probely-test-site
. Enter an optional *Description* and click *OK* +

Secret,width=875]#]

[[ProbelySecurityScannerPlugin-UsingtheplugininaFreestyleproject]]
=== Using the plugin in a Freestyle project

Freestyle Jenkins projects have been traditionally used to create
pipeline-like setups by chaining build steps together. To enable Probely
in a Freestyle project, the following steps may be used.

. Open Jenkins and click on *New Item*
. Enter your project name, choose *Freestyle Project* and click OK

https://github.com/jenkinsci/probely-security-plugin/blob/master/images/freestyle_0.png[[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .confluence-embedded-manual-size]#image:https://github.com/jenkinsci/probely-security-plugin/raw/master/images/freestyle_0.png[Freestyle
Project,width=875]#]

* Add Probely scan step

We assume that all required steps have been properly configured, such as
checking out from your SCM, testing, among others.

. Add the *Target Id*, as defined in the Generating an API key step.
. Select the right *credentials*, which were configured in Configuring
credentials. If the connection to Probely's API is working correctly,
and the credentials are valid, you should see the message "Credentials
verified successfully".
. When all steps are properly configured, click on *Save*

step,width=875]#]

[[ProbelySecurityScannerPlugin-UsingtheplugininaPipelineproject]]
=== Using the plugin in a Pipeline project

Pipeline projects are the new way to create build/test/deploy (among
others) pipelines in Jenkins. Pipelines are defined in a `+Jenkinfile+`,
which can be configured in an older imperative syntax, or in a more
modern declarative syntax. We describe how to use Probely using a
declarative `+Jenkinsfile+` to build a simple build/test/scan Pipeline.

* Open Jenkins and click on *New Item*
* Enter your project name, choose *Pipeline Project* and click *OK*

https://github.com/jenkinsci/probely-security-plugin/blob/master/images/pipeline_0.png[[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .confluence-embedded-manual-size]#image:https://github.com/jenkinsci/probely-security-plugin/raw/master/images/pipeline_0.png[Pipeline,width=875]#]

* Create a `+Jenkinsfile+`

We assume that the step to check out source code from your SCM is
properly configured. The following `+Jenkinsfile+` may be used as an
example to add Probely to your pipeline. It should be placed in the root
of your source code repository. This pipeline consists of an
hypothetical Java project, built with Gradle, with two stages: one
running unit tests and the other launching a scan with Probely. Note
that the `+targetId+` and `+credentialsId+` values refer to the
credentials obtained and configured previously.
