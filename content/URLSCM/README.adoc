This plugin allows the use of URLs as an SCM.

This is an SCM plugin for Jenkins. While URLs are not actually a proper
SCM, the two main behaviors of an SCM are supported - checkout and
polling. Polling is accomplished by checking the last-modified property
of the URL. Checkout is accomplished by copying the content of the URL
into the workspace as a file.  The file is given the same name as the
final filename component of the URL.  URLs without a filename component
cannot be used at this time.   +
This does duplicate some of what the
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/URL+Change+Trigger[URLChange
Trigger plugin] does.

Benefits this plugin over the URLChange Trigger are: +
1. You can choose your own polling schedule via the SCM Polling
trigger. +
2. Less resource intensive polling mechanism, since checking
last-modified requires few bytes to transfer, regardless of the amount
of data in the URL.

Benefits of URLChange Trigger over this plugin: +
1. Jenkins only supports one SCM plugin per project. If you want to
trigger an SCM checkout via a URL, then URLChange Trigger is a better
choice. +
2. The last-modified property of a URL is not the right trigger for your
builds, instead you need the content of the URL to change to trigger a
build.
