[.conf-macro .output-inline]#This plugin allows for the execution of a
http://nant.sourceforge.net/[NAnt] build as a build step.#

This plugin provides functionality similar to the Ant features built in
to Jenkins. Windows environments and non-Windows environments, running
NAnt via Mono, are supported.

[[NAntPlugin-Usage]]
== Usage

[[NAntPlugin-Usingthepluginwithoutanyconfiguration(recommended)]]
=== Using the plugin without any configuration (recommended)

If the NAnt executable is in your system's path, then you can use the
default executable without any further configuration. Unless there is a
need to use multiple versions of NAnt, this approach is recommended
rather than configuring an installation.

* *Windows*: the default executable is
+
....
NAnt.exe
....
* *Other OS's*: the default executable is
+
....
nant
....

[[NAntPlugin-ConfiguringaNAntinstallation(optional)]]
=== Configuring a NAnt installation (optional)

. Go to the Jenkins configuration page (i.e.
http(s)://<your-jenkins-url>/configure)
. Add a new NAnt installation in the *NAnt Builder* section
. Enter a name for the installation (i.e. nant-0.86-beta1)
. Enter the NAnt home directory.
* *Windows*: this must be a directory where the nant executable can be
found from the relative path
+
....
.\bin\NAnt.exe
....
* *Other OS's (Mac, Linux, etc.)*: this must be a directory where the
NAnt executable can be found from the relative path
+
....
./bin/nant
....

*Note*: If you have a master-slave configuration where one node is
running on Windows and the other running on a Unix-based platform, you
can configure a NAnt installation based on the node you wish to target.
Even if the plugin shows validation errors, you will still be able to
save the configuration. There are future plans to clean this
functionality up, but for now you will just have to ignore any
validation errors.

[[NAntPlugin-AddingaNAntbuildstep]]
=== Adding a NAnt build step

. Open the configuration for a new or existing Jenkins freestyle build
job
. In the "Build" section, add a new "Top Level NAnt Target" build step
. Choose a NAnt installation from the dropdown
. Optionally enter a build file
* The build file path, if entered, is relative to the workspace root
directory
. Optionally enter targets (separate multiple targets by a space)
. Click the "Advanced" button to enter optional property definitions.
* Property definitions are entered 1 per line, in the following format:
+
....
property1=value1
property2=value2
...
propertyN=valueN
....
* Use of build parameters is supported when setting property values
+
....
build.config=$buildConfiguration
....
