Lets one project track the Subversion revisions that are checked out for
another project.

 +
More than one module may be used, and the revision tracking will happen
for any URL in this project that exactly matches the tracked project.
For all other modules, the latest revision will be used.

When building, the TRACKING_SVN_BUILD environment variable will contain
the URL of the tracked build.

It is generally useless to use SCM polling if SVN tracking is enabled.
Instead, trigger this project from the tracked project.
