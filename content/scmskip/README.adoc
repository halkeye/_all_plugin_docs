SCM Skip Plugin skips build triggered by SCM webhooks based on the
commit message. If commit message matches given regular expression
freestyle or pipeline build is skipped. Default regex is
`+.*\[ci skip\].*+`, but can be overridden in global Jenkins
configuration or on specific job/pipeline.

The plugin enables deletion of skipped builds. This feature is available
for freestyle jobs and also for pipelines.

[[SCMSkipPlugin-Howitworks]]
== How it works

After SCM checkout SCM Skip plugin matches **last** commit message with
regular expression. For freestyle jobs, the plugin integrates early into
lifecycle after SCM checkout. Therefore, nothing is executed on a
positive regex match. 

For pipeline jobs, the plugin can be enabled as a pipeline step and
currently cannot be executed earlier in the Jenkins build lifecycle.

If last commit message matches the pattern, the build is aborted (and
deleted if enabled). For example, one of the matching messages would be:

* `+Updated version. New version: 1.0.1 [ci skip]+`
* `+[ci skip] Some changes+`
* `+[ci skip]+`

[[SCMSkipPlugin-GlobalConfiguration]]
== Global Configuration

The regular expression can be set in Jenkins global configuration under
"SCM Skip" section.

[[SCMSkipPlugin-Enableon:freestylejob]]
== Enable on: freestyle job

On a freestyle job, the plugin can be enabled
under the **Environment** section. Among other options, there is also a
checkbox for "SCM Skip". After enabling plugin there are also options to
override matching regex and enable deletion of skipped build.  A sample
configuration is depicted on an image below.

[[SCMSkipPlugin-Enableon:pipeline]]
== Enable on: pipeline

When using pipeline with a Jenkinsfile syntax (declarative or scripted),
the plugin can be enabled as a step in a stage with *scmSkip* step. The
plugin can be included anywhere in pipeline, but it is recommended to
include it as the first step. This way no other steps will be executed
if the build is skipped. How to include the plugin in the pipeline is
depicted on the image below. In the pipeline is also possible to
override the regex pattern and enable build deletion. Both parameters
are optional.
