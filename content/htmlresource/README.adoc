Jenkins HTML Resource plugin

This plugin allow managing webjars for javascript and css libraries from
within Jenkins +
Currently there is no easy way to add a javascript or css library to
jenkins to use them for theming, creating custom widgets etc.

Below are a few screenshots of how the plugin works, (I borrowed many
concepts from the scriptler plugin)

This screenshot shows that the plugin provides a new management like
called 'Manage HTML resources' for managing webjars +

Below is a screenshot of jquery webjar. The initialization script is
optional. It can be used to ad custom javascript code to the header. +
In the screenshot below some custom initialization code has been added
to prevent jQuery from conflicting with prototype.js
