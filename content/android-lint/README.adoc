[[AndroidLintPlugin-Features]]
== Features

http://tools.android.com/tips/lint[Android Lint] is a tool which scans
your Android projects and reports on potential bugs, performance,
security and translation issues, plus more.

This Jenkins plugin parses XML reports produced by running `+lint+`,
analyses them and displays the results for each build. +
Information shown includes a build summary, trend graphs, display of
warnings in context, and dashboard portlets.

This plugin builds on the work of the static analysis core plugin; see
the
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Static+Code+Analysis+Plug-ins[Static
Code Analysis Plug-ins] page for a fuller list of features.

[[AndroidLintPlugin-Requirements]]
== Requirements

* Jenkins 2.7 or newer
* The Static Analysis Utilities plugin — this will be automatically
installed when you install this plugin
* Android SDK Tools r17 or newer, but at least r21 is recommended

If the
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Dashboard+View[Dashboard
View] plugin is also installed, you will be able to add Lint-specific
portlets to your dashboard views.

[[AndroidLintPlugin-Configuration]]
== Configuration

[[AndroidLintPlugin-Jobconfiguration]]
=== Job configuration

[[AndroidLintPlugin-Freestylejobconfiguration]]
==== Freestyle job configuration

Enable "Publish Android Lint results" in the "Post-build Actions" of
your Jenkins job.

By default, the plugin will parse any files matching the pattern
"`+lint-results*.xml+`", anywhere in your build's workspace. +
This behaviour can be overridden by entering a filename or
https://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/fileset.html[pattern], relative to
the root of your build's workspace.

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/lint-config.png[image]#

[[AndroidLintPlugin-Pipelinejobconfiguration]]
==== Pipeline job configuration

You can generate the required
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Pipeline+Plugin[Pipeline]
syntax via the
https://jenkins.io/blog/2016/05/31/pipeline-snippetizer/[Snippet
Generator] by choosing the "androidLint: Publish Android Lint results"
step, but some quick examples follow.

The most basic configuration is this, which will analyse any files in
the workspace matching the default pattern `+**/lint-results*.xml+`:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
androidLint()
----

To specify the filenames or pattern to search for, use the `+pattern+`
parameter:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
androidLint pattern: 'foo/bar/my-app_lint-results.xml'
----

To mark the build as unstable if there are more than 10 Lint warnings,
and to mark the build as failed if there are more than 30 Lint warnings:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
androidLint unstableTotalAll: '10', failedTotalAll: '30'
----

To mark the build as failed if any high-priority warnings were
introduced since the last build:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
androidLint failedNewHigh: '0'
----

or older of the
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Pipeline+Groovy+Plugin[Pipeline

The most basic configuration is this, which will analyse any files in
the workspace matching the default pattern `+**/lint-results*.xml+`:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
step([$class: 'LintPublisher'])
----

To specify the filenames or pattern to search for, use the `+pattern+`
parameter:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
step([$class: 'LintPublisher', pattern: 'foo/bar/my-app_lint-results.xml'])
----

To mark the build as unstable if there are more than 10 Lint warnings,
and to mark the build as failed if there are more than 30 Lint warnings:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
step([$class: 'LintPublisher', unstableTotalAll: '10', failedTotalAll: '30'])
----

To mark the build as failed if any high-priority warnings were
introduced since the last build:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
step([$class: 'LintPublisher', failedNewHigh: '0'])
----

[[AndroidLintPlugin-ProducingLintoutput]]
==== Producing Lint output

Note that this plugin does not run Lint for you — you must provide Lint
results in XML format, either by running `+lint+` during a build, or by
copying the file(s) from somewhere else.

[[AndroidLintPlugin-ViaGradle]]
===== Via Gradle

If you're using the Gradle build system for Android, as of version 0.7
of the Android Gradle plugin, Lint integration is built-in.

By default, running the `+lint+` Gradle task will generate the Lint XML
file required by this plugin. +
However, you should disable the `+abortOnError+` option, to ensure that
the Gradle script reports success, even if Lint finds issues with your
project that it regards fatal.

You can do this by adding a `+lintOptions+` block at the end of your
`+android+` block in your `+build.gradle+` file:

....
android {
    // ...

    lintOptions {
        // Don't abort if Lint finds an error, otherwise the Jenkins build
        // will be marked as failed, and Jenkins won't analyse the Lint output
        abortOnError false
    }
}
....

Running `+./gradlew lint+` will compile your Android project, run Lint,
and write the results to `+build/lint-results.xml+`. +
As mentioned in the section above, this plugin will automatically find
and parse any files with this name.

If you run `+./gradlew lintDebug+`, the file will be called
`+lint-results-debug.xml+` — and the same pattern applies for other
build variants (i.e. the `+lintRelease+` task creates
`+lint-results-release.xml+`).

[[AndroidLintPlugin-Viathecommandline]]
===== Via the command line

If you're not using Gradle or some other build tool which automates the
execution of Lint, you will need to add an "Execute shell" build step to
your Jenkins job where you run `+lint+`.

For best results, run Lint in your Android application's directory,
e.g.: +
`+cd app; lint --xml --fullpath lint-results.xml .+`

*Note:* When running Jenkins on a headless system, or under a user ID
which doesn't have access to a graphical environment, you may see some
errors while running Lint. +
To combat this, you can run Java in headless mode, as follows: +
`+os_opts="-Djava.awt.headless=true" lint --xml --fullpath lint-results.xml .+`

[[AndroidLintPlugin-ChangingbuildoutcomebasedonLintresults]]
==== Changing build outcome based on Lint results

You can mark builds as unstable or failed, if the number of Lint issues
found — or introduced in the latest build — exceeds a certain threshold.

e.g. A build can be automatically flagged as unstable or failed if any
Lint issues with "Fatal" or "Error" severity are introduced.

To do this, in the job configuration, click "Advanced" in the "Publish
Android Lint results" section. Under "Status thresholds" you can change
the build to unstable (yellow ball) or failed (red ball). To mark a
build as unstable if there are more than 10 Lint issues in total, but
fail the build outright if even a single "Fatal"/"Error" issue exists,
then enter "10" under "All priorities" in the yellow row, and "0" under
"Priority high" in the red row.

i.e. If there are 12 normal-priority Lint issues found, this exceeds the
threshold of 10, causing the build to be marked as unstable. Or, if
there is a high-priority issue found, that would exceed the threshold of
0, thereby failing the build.

You should use this to be ruthless about fixing Lint issues as they
occur, and remember that you can exclude false positives by
http://tools.android.com/tips/lint/suppressing-lint-warnings[setting up
a `+lint.xml+` file] in the root of your app project.
