[[Bitbucket(Stash)NotifierPlugin-Overview]]
== Overview

This plugin notifies an Atlassian Bitbucket Server (formerly known as
Stash) instance of Jenkins builds in progress and of their results.

The build results will show up in the commit or pull request list in
Bitbucket and provide immediate and easy to scan feedback about a
commit.

It is possible to navigate from build result information in Bitbucket
directly to the build in question.

The plugin can be configured on a per-job basis, globally for all jobs
or both to minimize the configuration overhead.
