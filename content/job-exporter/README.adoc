Adds a build step that exports runtime parameters into a properties file
(e.g who triggered the build, what is her email address...). This
information can be read by other build steps.

To use it, edit the configuration of a particular job, go to "Build" and
click "Add build step", in the list select "Export Job runtime
parameters", this will create the files at the point in the build where
this step is executed.

[[JobExporterPlugin-Details]]
=== Details

This plugin exports Jenkins (runtime) job parameters into a
".properties" file. So other build steps (e.g. ant scripts) can read
those parameters and work with them. For example: send some information
via email to the user who triggered a job.

The property file is named "hudsonBuild.properties" and will be created
in the project workspace. This file contains the following informations:
