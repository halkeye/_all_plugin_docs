Let's say you have been working day in, day out on a new
spike/code/project locally on your laptop with a local git repo. And now
ready to publish this to the Bitbucket server. This would require
following steps:

{empty}1. Create a project on Bitbucket server.

{empty}2. Create the repository under the new project.

{empty}3. Assign users/group with write permissions to the project and
repository.

{empty}4. Finally import your code into the remote repository by adding
remote "origin" and pushing the code.

{empty}5. As an add-on, if you have Jenkins CI server, and want to run
the one
time https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.ngs.stash.externalhooks.external-hooks/server/overview[external
async post receive
hook. ](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.ngs.stash.externalhooks.external-hooks/server/overview).
The hook is disabled after pushing the code.  +
    (Note: The external post receive hook will be enabled with the
settings as shown below. The jenkins user/password is taken from the
credentials selected in plugin configuration).
