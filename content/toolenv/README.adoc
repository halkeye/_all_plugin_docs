== About this plugin

See http://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-4532 for motivation.

Some screenshots are better than a long discussion:

. This is what you define in Hudson's main config screen: +

. This is how you use the plugin in a job: +

. This is what you get: +

Compared to
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Custom+Tools+Plugin[Custom
Tools Plugin] the advantage is that you can use the tool in arbitrary
ways, not just running an executable from it. In the future these
plugins should be merged.
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/SharedObjects+Plugin[SharedObjects
Plugin] can also be used to achieve this plugin's effect.
