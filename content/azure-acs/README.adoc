A Jenkins Plugin to deploy configurations to Azure Container Service
(AKS).

It also supports deployment to the legacy Azure Container Service (ACS)
with the following orchestrator:

* https://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes]
* https://dcos.io/[DC/OS] with https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/[Marathon]
* https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/[Docker Swarm]

It also supports deployments
on https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/tutorial-kubernetes-prepare-app?branch=release-aks[Azure
Kubernetes Service].

It provides the following main functionality:

* Integration with ACS. Allow you to select existing ACS clusters and
manages the authentication credentials.
* Unified configure interface for all the supported orchestrator.
* Variable substitution for configurations, which enables dynamic
deployment in CI/CD.
* Docker login credentials management for pulling images from private
repository.

[[AzureContainerServicePlugin-Pre-requirements]]
== Pre-requirements

* AKS cluster, or an ACS cluster with the supported orchestrator
** https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-service/kubernetes/[Azure
Container Service with Kubernetes]
** https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-service/dcos-swarm/[Azure
Container Service with DC/OS and Swarm]
* A Azure service principal that can be used to manage the ACS cluster
** https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-application-objects[Application
and service principal objects in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)]
** https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal[Use
portal to create an Azure Active Directory application and service
principal that can access resources]
** https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Azure+Credentials+plugin[Azure
Credentials Plugin]
* Configurations for the target ACS cluster orchestrator, this can be
** Kubernetes resource configurations of the following kinds:
*** Deployment
*** Replica Set
*** Replication Controller - No rolling-update support. If that's
required, consider
using https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/#rolling-update-deployment[Deployment].
*** Daemon Set
*** Pod
*** Job
*** Service
*** Ingress
*** Secret - The plugin also provides secrets configuration.
** Marathon application configurations
** Docker compose configurations
+
In the context of container deployment, normally we should build a
Docker image from the project artifacts, and push the image to a
repository. This can be done with some existing plugins such
as https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/CloudBees+Docker+Build+and+Publish+plugin[CloudBees
Docker Build and Publish plugin].

[[AzureContainerServicePlugin-Configuretheplugin]]
== Configure the plugin

https://github.com/jenkinsci/azure-acs-plugin/blob/dev/img/screenshot.png[[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:https://github.com/jenkinsci/azure-acs-plugin/raw/dev/img/screenshot.png[screenshot]#]

. Within the Jenkins dashboard, Select a Job then select Configure
. Scroll to the "Add post-build action" drop down.
. Select "Deploy to Azure Container Service"
. Select the service principal from "Azure Credentials" dropdown. If no
credentials are configured, create one.
. All resource group names will be loaded into the "Resource Group"
dropdown. Select the one containing your ACS cluster.
. All the container service available in the selected resource group
will be loaded into the "Container Service" dropdown. Select your target
ACS cluster. (It's suggested that we use a standalone resource group to
manage an ACS cluster, and do not add other resources or ACS clusters
into the resource group.)
. Select the "Master Node SSH Credentials". This should be the
credentials of type "SSH Username with private key", where username is
the login name you specified when you create the ACS cluster
(`+azureuser+` by default), and private key is the one matching the
public key you specified on the ACS cluster creation (by default that
may be `+$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa+` on Linux
and `+%USERPROFILE%\.ssh\id_rsa+` on Windows).
. Enter the "Config Files" path of the configurations you want to
deploy, in the form
of https://ant.apache.org/manual/dirtasks.html#patterns[Ant glob
syntax]. Use comma (,) to separate multiple patterns.
. If you want to dynamically update the configurations on each build,
for example, use the `+$BUILD_NUMBER+` as the tag name of the image
being pulled, you can tick the "Enable Variable Substitution in Config"
option and the variables (in the
pattern `+$VARIABLE+` or `+${VARIABLE}+`) in the configurations will be
substituted with the corresponding value if they exists in the
environment variables.
. If the configurations needs to pull images from private repository,
click the "Docker Container Registry Credentials..." button and add them
one by one.
* For Kubernetes, you can enter the secret name and the namespace where
the secret will be created based on the credentials configured. The
credentials you provided will be consolidated into a Secret resource in
your Kubernetes cluster with the name you provided. You can use that
secret in your Kubernetes configuration.
+
You can use variables in the secret name (e.g., `+$BUILD_NUMBER+`), to
generate a secret specific to a build. The name will be exposed as
environment variable `+KUBERNETES_SECRET_NAME+` and you can use that in
your Kubernetes resource configurations if the "Enable Variable
Substitution in Config" option is turned on.

* For Marathon on DC/OS, you can specify the "DC/OS Docker Credentials
Path", the credentials you provided will be archived into a
file `+docker.tar.gz+`, and uploaded to the agent nodes in the path you
filled. You can use it to construct
the https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/native-docker-private-registry.html[URI
in your Marathon config]:
+
....
file://<absolute_path_you_filled>/docker.tar.gz
....
+
If this path is left blank, a unique path will be generated
under `+$HOME/acs-plugin-dcos.docker+`.
+
The URI will be exported to the environment
variable `+MARATHON_DOCKER_CFG_ARCHIVE_URI+` which you can use in your
Marathon configuration.

....
* Add a credentials entry for each of the private Docker registries
involved in your configuration. If it is hosted on DockerHub, you can
leave the URL as empty; otherwise for other private registries, you need
to specify the "Docker registry URL".
. You may verify the static configuration by clicking "Verify
Configuration". This will give you basic result of the configuration
quality. You need to run a sample build to verify it works as some of
the contents has to be loaded at build time.

[[AzureContainerServicePlugin-PipelineSupport]]
== Pipeline Support

To use the plugin in pipeline, go to the Pipeline Syntax page when you
configure the pipeline job, and choose acsDeploy: Deploy to Azure
Container Service from the Sample Step dropdown. You can configure it
and click Generate Pipeline Scriptwhich will give you
