[.conf-macro .output-inline]#This plugin enables Jenkins to load test
output from
http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/JCPtools2/[JavaTest]
test harness, which is commonly used by TCK tests for various JSRs.#

The plugin works much like the JUnit plugin, and provides historical
trend and other detailed views of the test result.
