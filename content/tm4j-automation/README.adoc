Jenkins plugin built for integrating automated tests
with https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1213259/tm4j-test-management-for-jira[Test
Management for Jira (TM4J)] on any Jira deployment (Cloud, Server and
DataCenter).

Test Management for Jira (TM4J) is the enterprise test management app to
plan, manage, and measure your entire testing life-cycle inside Jira for
both agile and waterfall methodologies. By using TM4J you'll empower
agile teams with BDD at scale with Cucumber or your chosen gherkin
compatible tool for collaboration between developers, testers and domain
experts. With our powerful FREE REST API, easily integrate CI/CD
servers, DevOps and test automation tools and frameworks you already use
(including Selenium, JUnit, Nunit, Robot, Behave, Calabash) to save time
and effort. TM4J is used by more than 3.000 clients worldwide and is the
top rated QA and Testing app for Jira.

The plugin introduces two new configuration steps for Jenkins jobs:

. A build step to export Gherkin feature files (BDD) from TM4J
. A post-build step to import the test results back to TM4J

These two configuration steps depends on a global configuration (Manage
Jenkins > Configure System) where the user can add/configure different
Jira instances to be used on each build step.
