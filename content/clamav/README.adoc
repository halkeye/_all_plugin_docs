[[ClamAVPlugin-Overview]]
== Overview

This plugin allows you to check the artifacts with
http://www.clamav.net/lang/en/[ClamAV], which is an open source (GPL)
antivirus engine designed for detecting Trojans, viruses, malware and
other malicious threats.

The artifacts are sent to ClamAV Host and are scaned. So you have to
configure your ClamAV to enable TCP port in clamd.conf as follows.

*clamd.conf*

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
:
# TCP port address.
# Default: no
TCPSocket 3310

# TCP address.
# By default we bind to INADDR_ANY, probably not wise.
# Enable the following to provide some degree of protection
# from the outside world.
# Default: no
#TCPAddr 127.0.0.1

# Close the connection when the data size limit is exceeded.
# The value should match your MTA's limit for a maximum attachment size.
# Default: 25M
StreamMaxLength 100M

Be Careful

To scan a workspace, you may specify "Files to check" option such as
"**/*". But it will take a long time. +
you may specify "Excludes" such as ".git/**/*".
