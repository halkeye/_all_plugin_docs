Configure projects to run with specified authorization.

[[AuthorizeProjectplugin-What'sthis?]]
== What's this?

This plugin provides following features:

* You can configure projects to have their builds run with specified
authorization.
** This is an implementation for
http://javadoc.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins/security/QueueItemAuthenticator.html[QueueItemAuthenticator].
* Provides following ways to specify authorization.
** Run as the user who triggered the build.
*** Does not work for scheduled, or polled builds.
*** Configuring projects are allowed only to users with the BUILD
permission.
** Run as anonymous.
** Run as the specified user.
*** You are requested to enter the password of the specified user except
following cases:
**** You are an administrator.
**** You are the specified user.
**** The specified user is not changed from the last configuration, and
"No need for re-authentication" is checked.
***** This can threaten your Jenkins security. Be careful to use.
*** Configuring projects are allowed only to administrators and the user
configured as the authorization.
**** "Don't restrict job configuration" allows other users (with the
CONFIGURE permission) to configure the project. Ensure that only
appropriate users have CONFIGURE permission for that project.
** Run as SYSTEM
*** This is provided only to cancel the global configuration. SYSTEM
authorization is often considered as "unconfigured", features provided
by plugins may treat it as anonymous.
* Provides an extension point to add new ways to specify authorization.

[[AuthorizeProjectplugin-Extensionpoint]]
== Extension point

A new way to authorize projects can be added with extending
`+org.jenkinsci.plugins.authorizeproject.AuthorizeProjectStrategy+`,
overriding the following method:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
public abstract Authentication authenticate(hudson.model.AbstractProject<?, ?> project, hudson.model.Queue.Item item);
----

Use `+AuthorizeProjectStrategyDescriptor+` for `+Descriptor+`. +
If you want to provide global configuration properties, do as following:

* `+global-security.jelly+` is displayed in "Configure Global Security"
page.
* Override
`+AuthorizeProjectStrategyDescriptor#configureFromGlobalSecurity+` to
save configuration.
