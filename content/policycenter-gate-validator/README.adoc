== Summary

[.conf-macro .output-inline]#The http://www.parasoft.com/[Parasoft]
Policy Center Gate Validator Plugin for Jenkins lets you add a build
step to check a Police Center policy gate. This enables you to
automatically stop a deployment if a policy gate is not successfully
passed.#

[[PolicyCenterGateValidatorPlugin-Prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

* Parasoft Development Testing Platform 5.3.1 or higher
* Parasoft PolicyCenter 3.2.1 or higher

[[PolicyCenterGateValidatorPlugin-Configuration]]
== Configuration

Each Jenkins server communicates with one Policy Center. Multiple
Jenkins servers can communicate with the same Policy Center.

. Go to Manage Jenkins.
. Go to Configure System.
. Scroll down to the Parasoft Policy Center area and enter your Policy
Center URL.

=== Adding a Check Policy Gate Build Step

You can add any number of "Check Policy" gates as build steps.

. Open the job you want to configure.
. Go to Configure.
. Under Add Build Step, select Check Policy Gate. Two new fields
(Project and Gate) will display.
. Under Project, select the project that the policy gate should apply
to.
. Under Gate, select the gate that you want applied.
. Under Post-build Actions, review the deployment trigger criteria and
update as needed, depending on whether you want the deployment to run
only when the gate is stable (i.e., if it shows Policy Center "success"
status), or if you will permit deployment if the gate is unstable or if
the gate fails.
