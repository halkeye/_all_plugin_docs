This plugin allows you to use MSBuild to build .NET and Visual Studio
projects.

[[MSBuildPlugin-Usage]]
== Usage

To use this plugin, specify the location directory of MSBuild.exe on
Jenkin's configuration page. The MSBuild executable is usually
situated in a subfolder of C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework. The
Visual Studio 2017 Community version of "msbuild.exe" is located in
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual
Studio\2017\Community\MSBuild\15.0\Bin\" If you have multiple MSBuild
versions installed, you can configure multiple executables.

Then, on your project configuration page, specify the name of the build
file (.proj or .sln) and any
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild-command-line-reference?view=vs-2017[command
line arguments] you want to pass in. The files are compiled to the
directory where Visual Studio would put them as well.

=== Troubleshooting

* When using Command Line Arguments, bear in mind that special
characters are treated like in Unix, so they will need to be escaped
using the backslash.
