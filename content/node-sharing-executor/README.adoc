Share machines as Jenkins agents across multiple Jenkins masters.

[[NodeSharingPlugin-Requirements]]
== Requirements

* The nodes are connected to the individual Jenkins masters so builds
can be executed there as if those nodes would be good old Jenkins nodes.
* The node to use is determined by evaluating Jenkins labels.
* Nodes are use exclusively by individual Jenkins masters.
* In case there is no matching node available at the time build is
scheduled the request will be queued and dispatched in FIFO fashion.

[[NodeSharingPlugin-Basics]]
== Basics

In order to facilitate fair sharing of agents, additional Jenkins master
is needed to serve the role of an _Orchestrator_, leasing the _Nodes_ to
_Executor_ Jenkinses.

The Executor Jenkins is an ordinary Jenkins with _Shared Nodes_ cloud
defined globally permitting it to lease, connect and utilize nodes from
a shared pool. Such Jenkins can use static slaves or other clouds in the
same time.

The Orchestrator Jenkins is a dedicated instance to instrument the
sharing. It is expected not to have any static nodes, clouds or jobs
defined as it is using the notion of computers, executors, builds and
queue items to implement the sharing. It also serve the purpose of grid
visualization UI for read only clients. It is not meant to be executing
any other workload.

Config repository is a git based record of the current configuration of
the pool the Orchestrator (and to some extend the Executors) takes as an
input. Ideally, the Orchestrator should have no other user configuration
except for what is in the config repository. In the name of reliability,
the config repository hold the full list of Jenkins masters authorized
to reserve from a particular pool. The repository, or the permission to
commit there, is the access control mechanism for the pool management.

The Node is a host used for sharing. It have several representations in
the Node Sharing Grid:

* Actual Jenkins agent connected by the cloud implementation to the
Executor Jenkins
* The placeholder computer in Orchestrator.
** Note this is not a real Jenkins computer capable of executing
anything except for dummy reservation tasks. It does not even have a
remoting channel open to the actual host despite it appears online.
* The record in config repository containing the node definition.

[[NodeSharingPlugin-Setup]]
== Setup

[[NodeSharingPlugin-ConfigRepo]]
=== Config Repo

* Create git repository cloneable from both Orchestrator and Executor
Jenkinses.
* Populate it with the grid definition.
** See the
https://github.com/jenkinsci/node-sharing-plugin/tree/master/example-config-repo[example
config repo] or use the
https://github.com/jenkinsci/node-sharing-plugin/blob/master/create-config-repo.sh[creation
script] to get started.

[[NodeSharingPlugin-Orchestrator]]
=== Orchestrator

* Create minimalistic Jenkins deployment
* Install `+node-sharing-orchestrator+` plugin including its
dependencies +
** https://updates.jenkins.io/download/plugins/node-sharing-orchestrator/
* Start Jenkins with following java properties
** `+-Dcom.redhat.jenkins.nodesharingbackend.Pool.ENDPOINT=cloneable_git_url_pointing_to_config_repo+`
** `+-Dcom.redhat.jenkins.nodesharingbackend.Pool.USERNAME=name_of_the_REST_user+`
** `+-Dcom.redhat.jenkins.nodesharingbackend.Pool.PASSWORD=password_of_the_REST_user+`
* Verify no Administrative Monitor warnings are issued once Jenkins is
started
* Configure dedicated automation account to receive incoming REST calls
granting it permission named `+NodeSharing.Reserve+`. No real user
should be granted this permission. How to do this is specific to
particular authorization strategy used.

[[NodeSharingPlugin-Executors]]
=== Executors

* Install `+node-sharing-executor+` plugin including its dependencies on
instances to utilize the pool
** https://updates.jenkins.io/download/plugins/node-sharing-executor/
* Note that node definitions in config repo can refer to further plugins
that needs to be installed on executors too.
* Add _Shared Nodes_ cloud specifying cloneable git url pointing to
config repo and credentials for the rest user.
* Create SSH credentials used to connect the machines. Their ids needs
to match those in config repo nodes.
* Configure dedicated automation account to receive incoming REST calls
granting it permission named `+NodeSharing.Reserve+`. No real user
should be granted this permission. How to do this is specific to
particular authorization strategy used
