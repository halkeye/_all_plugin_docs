[[LoadCompleteSupportPlugin-Usage]]
== Usage

. Prepare a test computer (node) for automated testing. Make sure the
node meets the following requirements to run tests successfully: +
* LoadComplete is installed on it and there is an available license.
* The installed LoadComplete version must be 4.95 or later.
* The LC project files must be copied to your job workspace in any
convenient way. To copy the files, you can, for example, use the Folder
Copy operation of the File Operations plugin.(
https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/File+Operations+Plugin) +
 
. Add the LoadComplete Test step to your Jenkins build. +
 
. Customize the step’s properties: specify the LoadComplete project file
and select the tests to be run. +
 
. Run the build as you normally would. +
 
. After the build run is over, you will see the LoadComplete Test
Results link on the build’s page. +
Click the link to view the test results. In the subsequent window, click
the link in the Test column to explore detailed test results.
