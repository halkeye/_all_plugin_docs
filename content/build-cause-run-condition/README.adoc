[[BuildCauseRunCondition-Features]]
== Features

This plugin implements a build cause run condition to be used by the
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Run+Condition+Plugin[Run
Condition Plugin].

[[BuildCauseRunCondition-BuildCauseCondition]]
=== Build Cause Condition

This provides an ExtensionPoint that can be used by plugins to define
new extended causes, for example this should be done for any trigger
that provides its Cause type that make provide extra information that
can be used.

Implemented:

* Started by a User +
This cause allows you to only run the condition when a particular
user(s) starts the build. +
if the users field is empty, it treats this as any user started build
returns true.

For example: +
Can be used to ignore all build requests from a particular user if they
are abusing the build now button.

* Started by upstream project +
This cause allows you to only run the condition when a particular
project(s) starts the build. +
If the projects field is empty, it treats this as any project started
build returns true.

For example: +
This allows configurations to perform different actions based which
upstream job started this one, this will allow you to collect artefacts
from just that upstream project rather than all of them.
