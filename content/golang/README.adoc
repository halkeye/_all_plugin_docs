[.conf-macro .output-inline]#Automatically installs and sets up the
http://golang.org/[Go programming language] (golang) tools for a build.#

[[GoPlugin-Whatitdoes]]
== What it does

During a build, this plugin can:

* Install a pre-configured version of Go to the machine the build is
running on
** The correct package for the machine's operating system, CPU
architecture and version will be automatically downloaded and installed,
if required
* Export the `+GOROOT+` environment, pointing to the installed Go tools
* Add the path `+$GOROOT/bin+` to the `+PATH+`, so that the tools are
available during the build

[[GoPlugin-Setup]]
== Setup

[[GoPlugin-Globalconfiguration]]
=== Global configuration

. In the Jenkins global tool configuration settings (Manage Jenkins →
Global Tool Configuration), find the "Go" section, click "Go
Installations..." and "Add Go".
. Enter a name, e.g. "Go 1.8" — the name itself has no significance, but
will be displayed to users during job configuration
. Either select "Install automatically" and select the desired Go
version from the drop-down list or specify the installation directory
manually

[[GoPlugin-Per-jobconfiguration]]
=== Per-job configuration

[[GoPlugin-Freestyle]]
==== Freestyle

. In a job's configuration, find the "Build environment" section
. Select the "Set up Go programming language tools" checkbox
. Select the Go version you wish to be installed when this job is built

[[GoPlugin-Pipeline]]
==== Pipeline

As with any other type of Tool Installer, you can use the `+tool+` step
to install Go, using the `+go+` tool type. For example:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
// Run on an agent where we want to use Go
node {
    // Install the desired Go version
    def root = tool name: 'Go 1.8', type: 'go'

    // Export environment variables pointing to the directory where Go was installed
    withEnv(["GOROOT=${root}", "PATH+GO=${root}/bin"]) {
        sh 'go version'
    }
}
----
