[[JobGeneratorPlugin-Summary]]
== Summary

This plugin adds a new job type "Job Generator" which can generate new
projects when executed.

[[JobGeneratorPlugin-Whythisplugin?]]
== Why this plugin ?

This plugin is a good fit for generating pipelines based on
parameterized templates. Typical parameter is the branch name or base
directory where to execute a job.

It is possible to do it with the built-in build parameters of Jenkins
but you have to manage input/output parameters for each job (i.e.
duplicate the branch name parameter) if you want to be able to execute a
job manually in the pipeline. Moreover some plugins don't expand
variables which can be a show-stopper till they get fixed. Last but not
least you may want to avoid to pollute the job history with different
parameters which make hard to follow trends (i.e. different branch
locations) and you need history isolation with different explicit jobs
pre-configured with each parameter value.

Of course you don't want to do this by hand as the number of jobs can
grow quickly if you have a big pipeline. Many teams work around this by
developing external tools to duplicate jobs. There are some plugins
available which allow to generate job configurations, you may want to
take a look a the
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Job+DSL+Plugin[Job DSL
Plugin].

The Job Generator plugin proposes a different approach by allowing to
define job templates in a natural way, there is no need to learn an
additional script language.

[[JobGeneratorPlugin-Features]]
== Features

* Global and Local Generator Parameters.
* Powered by the
plugins https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Parameterized+Trigger+Plugin[Parameterized
Trigger
Plugin], https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Conditional+BuildStep+Plugin[Conditional
BuildStep
Plugin] and https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Flexible+Publish+Plugin[Flexible
Publish Plugin]
* Pipeline generation and deletion in a few clicks.
* Conditional steps are resolved at generation time.
* Requires explicit action from the user for critical operations.
* Should support all free-style job plugins out of the box.
* Hot creation/deletion of jobs. No need to reload from disk and restart
jenkins.

[[JobGeneratorPlugin-Howitworks?]]
== How it works ?

A job generator copies itself when it is executed replacing all
generator parameters by the given values. The conditional entries
(https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Conditional+BuildStep+Plugin[Conditional
BuildStep
Plugin] and https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Flexible+Publish+Plugin[Flexible
Publish Plugin]) are resolved during the generation so generated job
configurations are clean.

By using
the https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Parameterized+Trigger+Plugin[Parameterized
Trigger Plugin] (see example below) you can generate multiple jobs in
one pass by calling a downstream job generator multiple times with
different parameter values; this way you can fork jobs easily.

[[JobGeneratorPlugin-Configuration]]
== Configuration

After installing the plugin you'll get a new entry in the Job creation
view.

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/JobGenerator.png[image]# +
_A new type of job_

The job configuration view is the same as a free-style software build
job with a few additions:

* New choices of build parameters:  _Generator Parameter_, and
_Generator Choice Parameter._
* New choices of parameters for
the https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Parameterized+Trigger+Plugin[Parameterized
Trigger Plugin]: _Generator Parameter_ and _Current Generator
Parameters_.
* Text box entries to provide the name of the generated job as well as
its display name (section is at the bottom of the configuration page).
* Check box to automatically run the generated job once the generation
is complete.

_Trigger build parameters_

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/GeneratedJobName.png[image]# +
_Provide a name for the generated job_

When a Job Generator is executed an action view is displayed allowing
you to define the declared generator parameters and to set several
options:

* Process this job only: Downstream jobs are skipped.
* Delete jobs: If checked, the jobs are deleted instead of being
generated.

[[JobGeneratorPlugin-Usage]]
== Usage

[[JobGeneratorPlugin-Inanutshell]]
=== In a nutshell

Define your pipeline once with job generators => Make instances of your
pipeline by running the top most job generator (trigger of your
pipeline). There is no need to restart the server to use the generated
jobs.

[[JobGeneratorPlugin-Details]]
=== *Details*

*Parameters*

Parameters are defined using the regular build parameters of Jenkins.
New types of build parameters and factories allow to define generation
parameters:

* Predefined Generator Parameter: a key-value parameter.
* Generator Choice Parameter: a set of predefined key-value parameters.
* Counter Generator Parameter Factory: it creates generator parameters
based on a counter.
* File Generator Parameter Factory: it creates generator parameters
based on a list of parameters stored in a file.

As you can see on the above screenshot, Generator Parameters are
splitted into two categories depending on their declaration location:

* Global: These parameters are declared in the top most jobs of the
pipeline (the trigger jobs). They are globally available in the whole
pipeline.
* Local: These parameters are declared in any other jobs which are not
top most. They are only visible for the job which declares them. This is
useful to fork a generation at a certain point in the pipeline, this is
possible by using
the https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Parameterized+Trigger+Plugin[Parameterized
Trigger Plugin] which can call the same Job Generator several times with
different values for the local Generator Parameters.

*Job Names*

The name of a generated job must be provided and it cannot be the same
as the Job Generator name or cannot produce a name of a Job Generator. +
To let the display name parameter available to the Job Generator, a
special configuration item is available in the Additional Configuration
section to define the display name for the generated jobs.

*Recommended additional plugins*

This plugin works best coupled to the following plugins:

* https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Conditional+BuildStep+Plugin[Conditional
BuildStep Plugin]
* https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Flexible+Publish+Plugin[Flexible
Publish Plugin]
* https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Parameterized+Trigger+Plugin[Parameterized
Trigger Plugin]

*Good practices*

* You can prefix the Job Generator names (i.e. name starting with TL_)
and put them in a special view with a matching regular expression. Use
of the https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/View+Job+Filters[View
Job Filters] to hide this view to non-admin users.

[[JobGeneratorPlugin-AdvancedUsage]]
== Advanced Usage

[[JobGeneratorPlugin-Ontheflyreplacement]]
=== *On the fly replacement*

It is possible to perform string replacement operations at generation
time. There are 2 special forms for string replacement:

* Asterisk
* Regular expression (something like sed)

*Asterisk form* +
If you put an asterisk at the end of a variable name then all special
characters will be replaced by underscores. +
Exhaustive special characters list:  *\ / : * ? " < > |* 

Example:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
FOO = "<Hello::World>"
${FOO*}= "_Hello__World_"
----

Note: Generated job names are always generated with the asterisk form.

*Regular expression form* +
Regular expression can be specified with an _a la sed_ syntax. Some
examples are worth a thousand word:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
FOO = "One more hello world example"
${FOO/.*(hello).*/$1} = "hello"
${FOO/\s/_} = "One_more_hello_world_example"
----

[[JobGeneratorPlugin-Example/Tutorial]]
== *Example/Tutorial*

Given a pipeline

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
A > B > C
----

where A is the trigger job which defines the following global generator
parameter:

* BRANCH

And C is the last job which defines the local generator parameter:

* LANGUAGE

Configuration of job A

* A build parameter with type _Generator Parameter_ and name *BRANCH*
* An _Execute Shell_ build step:* echo A*
* _Generated Job Name_: 
+
[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
${BRANCH}_A
----
* _Generated Job Display Name_: 
+
[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
(${BRANCH}) A Trigger
----
* A publisher _Trigger a parameterized build_ for job B with:
** a parameter type _Current Generator Parameters_

Configuration of job B

* _Generated Job Name_:
+
[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
${BRANCH}_B
----
* _Generated Job Display Name_:
+
[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
(${BRANCH}) B
----
* An _Execute Shell_ build step: *echo B*
* A publisher _Trigger a parameterized build_ for job C with:
** a parameter type _Current Generator Parameters_
** a parameter type _Generator Parameter_: *LANGUAGE=Cpp*
* Another_ _publisher _Trigger a parameterized build_ for job C with:
** a parameter type _Current Generator Parameters_
** a parameter type Generator Parameter: *LANGUAGE=Java*

Configuration of job C

* _Generated Job Name_:
+
[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
 ${BRANCH}_${LANGUAGE}_C
----
* _Generated Job Display Name_:
+
[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
(${BRANCH}) C (${LANGUAGE})
----
* An _Execute Shell_ build step:
+
[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
echo ${LANGUAGE}
----

Launch a build on job A with BRANCH=prod, the generated jobs are:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
prod_A > prod_B > prod_Cpp_C
                > prod_Java_C
----

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
(prod) A > (prod) B > (prod) C (Cpp)
                    > (prod) C (Java)
----

When this pipeline is executed the following merged output is:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
~$ A
~$ B
~$ Cpp
~$ Java
----

[[JobGeneratorPlugin-Limitations]]
== Limitations

* Support for free-style build software jobs only.
* Job generators cannot use _Poll SCM_ and _Time_ triggers (but it is
possible to define a free-style top level job to trigger the
generation).

[[JobGeneratorPlugin-Todolist]]
== Todo list

* Check for the possibility to support all kind of jobs.
* Preview of impacted jobs in the generation view.
* Batch generation by providing multiple values separated by commas.
