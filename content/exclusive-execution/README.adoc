Allows a job to be executed when no other jobs are running.

[[ExclusiveExecutionPlugin-Possibleuses]]
== Possible uses

Execute a backup job: because backup-plugin cannot be scheduled, then I
have created my own Jenkins backup script. To run it from Jenkins I
crated a 'maintenance' job that must execute when there are no other job
running, so this plugin can help perform this backup procedure.

[[ExclusiveExecutionPlugin-Howitworks]]
== How it works

When this option is enabled, then for every build one pre-build and one
post-build steps are executed:

*pre-build steps*:

. The plugin will initiate a shutdown mode which means that no other
jobs can be started.
. It waits until every job except this one has finished, unless it is
indicated not to wait through optional flag. 
. Then it starts to execute the job.

*post-build steps* (executed always even if the build is not succesful):

. Jenkins shutdown mode is canceled
