This new version is backward compatible with the OO 9.x servers but with
limited functionality. In other words you can use this version to run
the 9.x flows as you already did but for all the new features you need
to have OO 10.x version.

*HP OO Content for Jenkins*

* *

            As part of the
https://hpln.hp.com/group/operations-orchestration[HP OO Community],
content for Jenkins was created. This content is open for changes and
free for use by any OO customer. The content can be used to interact
with Jenkins continuous integration application and implements basic use
cases such as running jobs and getting details about different jobs. The
content allows you to communicate back to the Jenkins CI Server from the
same workflow that was triggered by the plugin

[[HPOperationsOrchestrationAutomationExecutionPlugin-ReportingintheJenkinsconsole]]
== Reporting in the Jenkins console

            The plugin writes in the Jenkins console the following
information: <serverName> +
Authentication will be used for the user : <username> +
Central version : <centralVersion> +
Global Keystore : <globalKeystoreFile> +
Running <flowName> on <serverName> with parameters <parameters> +
The flow: <flowName> with UUID <flowUUID> is executing... +
Step Execution Timeout : <stepExecutionTime> ms             After this
information is logged, the actual execution starts on the OO Central
server.             After the execution completes, the plugin outputs
the entire JSON from the execution log.       The last bit of
information written by the plugin in the console is the actual URL to
the execution from Central.

[[HPOperationsOrchestrationAutomationExecutionPlugin-ConfiguringSSLforthepluginon9.xversionsofOO]]
== Configuring SSL for the plugin on 9.x versions of OO

            If the Operations Orchestration server is configured to run
over HTTPS, then in order for the Operations Orchestration plugin to be
able to communicate with the Operations Orchestration server, the OO
plugin trustStore must contain the public key of the certificate used by
the server.

            To manually import a security certificate into the
Operations Orchestration plugin’s JKS truststore, you must perform the
following steps:

* Export the OO server’s certificate public key,
from *<INCONCLUDE_HOME>\conf\rc_keystore* : >keytool -export -keystore
rc_keystore -alias pas -file PasPublicCert.cer     * Import the OO
server’s certificate into the plugin truststore on the Jenkins machine
:>keytool --importcert --keystore oo_plugin_truststore --file
PasPublicCert.cer -alias pas* After the import, verify that the import
was successful using the command: >keytool --list --keystore
oo_plugin_truststore            The Operations Orchestration plugin
truststore will contain the *TrustedCertEntry* with the imported key and
the provided alias (pas).

== Configuring SSL for the plugin on 10.x versions of OO 

[[HPOperationsOrchestrationAutomationExecutionPlugin-A.Self-signedcertificate]]
=== A. Self-signed certificate

. Stop Central and back up the original key.store file, located in

            _<installation dir>/central/var/security/key.store_

_ _

. Open a command line in <installation dir>/central/var/security.
. Delete the existing server certificate from the Central key.store
file, using the following

            _keytool -delete -alias tomcat -keystore key.store
-storepass <changeit>_

. Generate a self-signed certificate:

            _keytool -genkey -alias tomcat -keyalg RSA -keypass
<changeit >-keystore             <path/for/new/Keystore> -storepass
<changeit>-storetype pkcs12 -dname_

_            "CN=<CENTRAL_FQDN>, OU=<ORGANIZATION_UNIT>,            
O=<ORGANIZATION>, L=<LOCALITY>, C=<COUNTRY>"_

            Note: If you do not enter a path for generating the new
keystore, it is created in the folder where you entered the command, for
example <installation dir>/central/var/security.

. Import the self-signed certificate to the Central key.store file:

            _keytool -v -importkeystore -srckeystore
<new/path/created/Keystore> -srcstoretype    PKCS12 -srcstorepass
<changeit> -destkeystore key.store -deststoretypeJKS -     
deststorepass <changeit>_

            6. Start Central. 

[[HPOperationsOrchestrationAutomationExecutionPlugin-B.CACertificate]]
=== B. CA Certificate

            This information is present in the Hardening guide delivered
with OO 10.10 and newer versions. The following procedure uses the
Keytool utility that is located in <installation dir>/java/bin/keytool
on the Central server.

{empty}1. Stop Central and back up the original key.store file, located
in

_<installation dir>/central/var/security/key.store._

_2. _Open a command line in <installation dir>/central/var/security.

{empty}3. Delete the existing server certificate from the Central
key.store file

             _keytool -delete -alias tomcat -keystore key.store
-storepass changeit_

 4. If you already have a certificate with .pfx or .p12 extension, then
go to the next step.

If not, then export the certificate with private key into PKCS12 format
(.pfx, .p12).

        For example, if the certificate format is PEM:

             _>openssl pkcs12 --export --in <cert.pem> -inkey <key.key>
-out <certificate name>.p12      --name <name>_

        If the certificate format is DER, add the --inform DER parameter
after pkcs12.

             _>openssl pkcs12 --inform DER --export --in <cert.pem>
-inkey <.key> -out <certificate    name>.p12 --name <name>_

        Note: Make a note of the password that you provide. You will
need this password for the         private key when you input the
keystore passphrase later in this procedure.

 5. Extract the alias for your certificate’s alias, using the following
command:

             _keytool -list -keystore <certificate_name> -v -storetype
PKCS12_

            The alias is displayed.

{empty}6. Import the PKCS12 format server certificate to the Central
key.store file:

            _keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore <PKCS12 format
certificate path> -destkeystore    key.store -srcstoretype pkcs12
-deststoretype JKS -alias <cert alias> -destalias tomcat_

{empty}7. It is recommended to change the default “changeit” password in
the automatically-generated keystore in the Central server.

{empty}8. Start Central.

[[HPOperationsOrchestrationAutomationExecutionPlugin-MatrixConfigurationJob]]
== Matrix Configuration Job

            A matrix is a collection of smaller jobs. Each job runs a
flow on a Central with a certain combination of inputs.  If any of the
smaller jobs fails, the main job will fail. +

Invoking simple operations is not supported.            +

            The 3 types of information that can generate the matrix
are: +

             - What flow runs

             - What Central the flow runs on

             - What inputs the flow runs with +

            The plugin can be used to trigger the following types of
scenarios: +

* Running a flow on the same Central with different values for some
input(s).
* Running different flows on different Centrals with the same, hardcoded
inputs.
* Running different flows on different Centrals with different input
values. +

In order to create a matrix, add a new _Multi-configuration project_
item in Jenkins.

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/matrixConfig_1.png[image]# +
After the project is created, the next step is to add the axis and a HP
Operations Orchestration Flow Execution Build Step.

*__ ____Example 1:__* +

            If you want to run the flows _f1_ and _f2_ on the Central
servers _s1_ and _s2_, there will be a total of 4 smaller jobs
(mini-jobs), each testing one of the 4 combinations.

The flows and servers are actually generating the 2x2 matrix with the 4
mini-jobs.

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/matrixConfig_2.png[image]#

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/matrixConfig_3.png[image]#

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
 s_server
 f_flow
 i_${inputName}
----

For the plugin to know what servers, flows and inputs you want to use,
you need a specific syntax to input the axis values in a matrix
configuration job, as follows:| +
   +
    The f_flow values are relative to the Basepath defined in the build
step.   

            The axis _Values_ list elements will be injected at runtime
in each mini-job.

            The s_server values must match labels already defined in the
_Manage Jenkins/Configure System/HP Operations Orchestration section_
(see Example 3); otherwise the corresponding jobs will fail because the
target server does not contain a valid Central on which to run the flows
on.

            If s_servers are not specified, the server set in the build
step will be the target Central.          

            If the f_flows values are used to generate the matrix, the
flows they represent must be located in the _Basepath_ folder. The value
from the “Select Flow to Execute on Server” is ignored in this case, but
must be supplied.

*_ _*

*_Example 2:_*

            For the sample flow Random Number Generator (from Base CP),
that has 2 inputs _min_ and _max_ and generates a random number between
_min_ and _max_, the axis could be specified like:
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/matrixConfig_4.png[image]# +
A 3 x 3 matrix will be generated; each of the 9 mini-jobs will run the
flow on the server specified in the build step, with different values
for _min_ and _max._

_           _ The mini-job that has _min=500_ and _max=101_ fails
because this is an invalid input combination for the flow.

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/matrixConfig_5.png[image]# +
In this situation you can use the Combination filter option in the
Jenkins job to skip the invalid configuration. For more options on this
combination filter you can use the help button available to the right of
the field.

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/matrixConfig_6.png[image]# +
*_Example 3:_*     +

            If one of the axis is generated with _f_flow_, and multiple
flows have common inputs with common values that do not generate the
matrix, those can be specified in the Build step section like in the
normal, non-matrix scenario.

            In this example, the matrix will run 2 flows: _Addition and
Subtraction_, located in the same folder in Central,
_/Library/EvaluatorExample_._ _ Both flows have 2 inputs called _value1_
and _value2_. The first input is populated through the matrix axis, and
the 2nd through the build step.
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/matrixConfig_7.png[image]#

After the execution finishes, the matrix will look like this:

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/matrixConfig_8.png[image]#

Below is the console output corresponding to the “Addition, 10”
mini-job.
