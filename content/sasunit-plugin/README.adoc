== Configure the SASUnit Tool Installation

Before a build step can be run successfully, at least one SASUnit
installation must be configured. You are free to configure as many
installations as needed.

To add an installation go to Jenkins->Manage Jenkins->Configure System.
There you will find the following form field. +
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .confluence-embedded-manual-size]#image:docs/images/ubuntu15.jpg[image,width=387,height=108]# +
To add a SASUnit Version press "Add SASUnit".

Configure the installation by providing a

. Name for the installation. This name references the installation and
will be available in the configuration of the build step.
. A path to the root directory of the installation. This path will be
used as a default on all your nodes.

If you got SASUnit installations on different nodes using different
paths e.g. in Linux and Windows environments you can supply node
specific paths for every installation. Therefore go to Jenkins->Manage
Jenkins->Manage Nodes and configure the node in question. +
