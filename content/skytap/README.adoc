This plugin allows you to use Jenkins to run continuous integration and
automated testing workflows using dynamically-created development and
testing environments in http://www.skytap.com/[Skytap]

Sections in this document:

[[SkytapCloudCIPlugin-Introduction]]
== Introduction

The *Skytap Cloud CI Plugin for Jenkins* allows you to create and
configure http://www.skytap.com/[Skytap Cloud] environments as part of
your Jenkins-based continuous integration workflow. 

In a matter of minutes, you can create a Skytap virtual environment from
a golden template and then use that environment to develop your
application or run test passes for unit testing, functional testing,
integration testing, stress/performance testing or user acceptance
testing. All of the VM and network settings are saved with the template,
so once you've created an environment, the network is already set up and
you're ready to go. 

With *Skytap Cloud CI Plugin for Jenkins*, you can add the following
actions to your Jenkins build steps:

[[SkytapCloudCIPlugin-BeforeYouBegin]]
