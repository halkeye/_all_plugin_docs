This plugin makes it possible to archive the workspace from builds of
one project and reuse them as the SCM source for another project.

[[CloneWorkspaceSCMPlugin-Usage]]
== Usage

[[CloneWorkspaceSCMPlugin-Publisher]]
=== Publisher

* In the configuration for a project whose workspace you want to clone
and re-use in other projects, select "Archive for Clone Workspace SCM"
in the list of publishers.
* If desired, specify the files to include in the archive - by default,
this will be "**/*". Use Ant-style globs.
* Specify the criteria a build needs to meet in order to be archived.
* Run a build. If it meets the criteria, its workspace will be archived,
until a new build meeting the criteria has run, at which point the old
archive will be deleted.

[[CloneWorkspaceSCMPlugin-SCM]]
=== SCM

* In the configuration for a project which you wish to have re-use
another project's workspace, select "Clone Workspace" from the list of
possible SCMs.
* Choose the parent project whose workspace you wish to re-use from the
drop-down list - if no projects have the Clone Workspace Publisher
enabled, the drop-down will be empty.
* Choose the parent build criteria you wish to use.
* Run a build - assuming the parent project has an archived workspace
meeting the criteria in question, it'll be expanded and used as the
workspace for this build.
* Additionally, the changelog from the parent project build that
archived workspace came from will be re-used as the changelog for this
build.
