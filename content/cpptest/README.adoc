This plugin allows you publish
http://www.parasoft.com/jsp/products/home.jsp?product=Wizard&[Parasoft
C++test] test results.

This plugin makes it possible to import Parasoft C++test reports from
each build into Hudson so they are displayed with a trend graph and
details about which tests that failed.

[[CpptestPlugin-KnownProblems]]
== Known Problems

The followings are known problems and improvements for static analysis
report of Cpptest plugin v.0.9. +
(some of them were fixed by ahebert, thanks!)

* (middle) _Flow analysis result_ (Bug Detective of C++test) are ignored
** *FlowViol* elements should be processed similarly to StdViol
* (middle) _Suppressed warnings_ are also counted as warnings
** StdViol and FlowViol elements which have *@supp="true"* should be
ignored
* (minor) _help.html_ of job configuration is not shown
* (minor) __Link to target source file__s from Cpptest report web page
may be lost
** How other plugins supported by static-core can find correct source
path?
* (improvement) hopefully,  the metrics below should be also output, so
that 'no warning' means  to be really happy to you !
** _the total number of rules_
** _the total number of suppressed warnings_
* (minor) _The number of warnings_ reported by Cpptest plugin is often
less than that of C++test native report.
** It seems to be because C++test reports multiple warnings of the same
kind in the same line, for example, +
C++test reports multiple warnings of 'non-ascii tab character' against
every TAB in the same line.
