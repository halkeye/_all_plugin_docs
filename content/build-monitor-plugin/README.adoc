Build Monitor Plugin provides a highly visible view of the status of
selected Jenkins jobs.

It easily accommodates different computer screen sizes and is ideal as
an Extreme Feedback Device to be displayed on a screen on your office
wall. +
(Inspired by the no longer maintained RadiatorView plugin).

If the plugin doesn't appear in your Jenkins Update Centre, visit Manage
Plugins / Advanced and click the "Check now" button to make Jenkins
retrieve the latest update-center.json data.

[[BuildMonitorPlugin-Features]]
== Features

I'd like to keep the plugin as simple as possible, yet useful and
effective.

Current functionality of the Build Monitor plugin:

. Displays the status and progress of selected jobs, the view is updated
automatically every couple of seconds using AJAX. No "Enable Auto
Refresh" needed.
. Displays the names of people who might be responsible for "breaking
the build".
. Supports the
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Claim+plugin[Claim plugin],
so that you can see who's fixing a broken build
. Supports
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/View+Job+Filters[View Job
Filters], so that you can easily create Build Monitors for "slow
builds", "only failing", etc.
. Supports
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Build+Failure+Analyzer[Build
Failure Analyzer], so that you know not only _who_, but also _what_
broke the build; more http://bit.ly/JBMBuild102[here]
. Supports
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/CloudBees+Folders+Plugin[CloudBees
Folders Plugin], so that you can have project- and team-specific nested
Build Monitors; more http://bit.ly/JBMBuild117[here]
. The number of columns and size of the font used is easily
customisable, making it trivial to accommodate screens of different
sizes.
. UI configuration is stored in a cookie, making it possible to display
different number of columns and using different font size on each of the
screens at your office.
. Can work in a colour-blind-friendly mode

[[BuildMonitorPlugin-Settingup]]
== Setting up

To create a new Build Monitor View, click on the "New View" tab, select
"Build Monitor View" and select jobs you wish to display on the monitor.

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/Setting-up.png[image]#

You can have as many Build Monitor Views as you wish - the most popular
approach is to have one per team or one per project.
