== DropDown ViewsTabBar Plugin

This plugin provides an alternate rendering of the Views bar which runs
along the top of all views. This plugin is useful for instances which
have a very large number of views and want a compact
rendering.[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/screenshot-1.0.png[image]# +

To use the DropDown ViewsTabBar go to *Manage Jenkins* > *Configure
System*, select it in the *Views Tab Bar* drop down box and save the
configuration.

Some users report performance problems with this plugin enabled under
the following conditions: Nested Views Plugin enabled, many Views
created, those Views use complex regex in order to filter jobs, and this
plugin configured to show job counts (configurable in System
Configuration page).
