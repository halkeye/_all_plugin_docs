Since Version 1.25 this plugin uses Ivy 2.4.0 internally (but it should
work with Ivy 2.+ projects)

[[IvyPlugin-CreatingAnIvyProject(addedinversion1.0ofthisplugin)]]
== Creating An Ivy Project (added in version 1.0 of this plugin)

By using an Ivy project instead of a Freestyle project Jenkins can
simplify the job configuration. It will auto-detect all the ivy modules
you checked out, create builds for them, and automatically generate the
upstream/downstream build triggers based on your Ivy dependencies.

. Click on the "New Job" link +
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/new-job.png[image]#
. Enter a project name and choose "Build an Ivy project" +
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/new-ivy-project.png[image]#
. Fill in your SCM details (you can choose to check out a single ivy
module, or an entire branch of ivy modules)
. Choose the Ant version to build with and enter the targets you want
run. Most of the options have sensible defaults so you only need to fill
them in if your modules are set up differently than the default values
expect. If you want to build each module as a separate job, expand the
"Advanced" section and check "Build modules as separate jobs". If you
are polling for changes from your SCM, you can also optionally choose to
only build changed modules. +
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/ivy-project-configuration.png[image]#
. Now on your Jenkins job page you will see a "Modules" link +
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/modules.png[image]#
. This will give you a view of all the discovered ivy modules you
checked out (Note: you will need to build the project once before the
modules show up) +
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/modules-view.png[image]#
. The upstream/downstream project build triggers will be automatically
generated from the dependencies in your ivy files. +
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/upstream-downstream.png[image]#
. If you chose to build the modules as separate jobs, then you can click
on a module in the module view to see all the individual builds, SCM
changes, artifacts, etc.
. If you want to run different targets on a certain module then you can
override the default targets in the module configuration. +

 Upon building, it scans the ivy.xml and fills in the 'build other
projects' setting, which results in output on the project page of which
projects are upstream (depends on) and which are downstream (is a
dependency).

* Implemented
http://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-9464[JENKINS-9464] - Added

=== Version 1.14 (Nov 16, 2010)

* Fixed http://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-8012[JENKINS-8012] -
Ivy plugin now bundles jsch and commons-vfs since those classes may have
to be loaded when parsing the Ivy settings file. Referencing a settings
file with sftp/ssh/vfs resolvers should work now.

[[IvyPlugin-Version1.13(Nov1,2010)]]
=== Version 1.13 (Nov 1, 2010)

* Added support for using build wrappers when building modules as
separate jobs. (patch supplied by Jesse Bexten)
** Now build wrappers like locks and latches and the version number
plugin can be configured for an Ivy Project that's configured to build
its modules as separate jobs. In this case the build wrappers will be
applied to each module individually.
* Fixed several oversights in the Ivy module build logic. Logic now more
closely resembles that in the standard Build$RunnerImpl. The
BuildWrappers are now torn down properly, and return values from post
build actions are checked.

[[IvyPlugin-Version1.12(Oct22,2010)]]
=== Version 1.12 (Oct 22, 2010)

* Fixed a bug whereby any build triggers manually configured for
individual Ivy modules were ignored.
** This only affected Ivy Projects using the "Build modules as separate
jobs" option and the "Build other projects" option for individual Ivy
modules.

[[IvyPlugin-Version1.11(Oct14,2010)]]
=== Version 1.11 (Oct 14, 2010)

* Added ability to optionally use Parameters from upstream jobs
triggered by their Ivy dependencies (patch supplied by Jesse Bexten)
** This applies to Ivy Projects triggering other Ivy Projects, Ivy
Projects triggering their own modules to build when they have been
configured to build their modules as separate jobs, and also Freestyle
jobs using the Ivy Build Trigger to trigger other Freestyle jobs.
** In all cases, an additional checkbox is provided that will cause the
builds to use the same parameters as the jobs that triggered them.

[[IvyPlugin-Version1.10(Sep30,2010)]]
=== Version 1.10 (Sep 30, 2010)

* Added ability to disable the automatic triggering of downstream Ivy
dependencies in other Jenkins projects.
* Fixed http://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-7602[JENKINS-7602] -
Incremental Ivy builds work on Windows now.

[[IvyPlugin-Version1.9(Jul29,2010)]]
=== Version 1.9 (Jul 29, 2010)

* Fixed spammy exception logging on startup if the NAnt plugin wasn't
installed. The NAnt builder extension is now marked as optional.
* Exposed a couple of environment variables in multi-module Ivy builds.
Now when building a multi-module Ivy project as separate builds,
IVY_MODULE_NAME and IVY_MODULE_ORGANISATION are available. This is
leading up to better integration with the Jenkins
https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/SonarQube+plugin[SonarQube
plugin].
* Fixed http://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-7085[JENKINS-7085] -
Ivy Projects using multi-module, non-aggregated, incremental build will
now always build their modules in the correct order
* *Note:* requires Jenkins 1.358 or newer

[[IvyPlugin-Version1.8(Jul21,2010)]]
=== Version 1.8 (Jul 21, 2010)

* Added workaround for issue introduced in Jenkins v1.363 where a
self-referential build trigger gets created causing a project to trigger
itself endlessly
http://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-6819[JENKINS-6819].
* Implemented
http://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-6802[JENKINS-6802] -
Refactored project builder logic to allow Ivy Project builders to be
pluggable. Implemented the Ant (default) and NAnt builder types.
* Applied a patch from the http://www.jfrog.org/[JFrog] guys to support
integration with the next release of their
https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Artifactory+Plugin[Artifactory
Plugin].
* Implemented
http://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-6884[JENKINS-6884] - Added
ability to specify property files that need to get loaded before parsing
the Ivy settings and Ivy module descriptors. This allows Ivy Projects to
work properly when using ant property references in the Ivy settings
file or module descriptors.

[[IvyPlugin-Version1.7(May13,2010)]]
=== Version 1.7 (May 13, 2010)

* Fixed http://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-6468[JENKINS-6468] -
Added an option to specify an ivy settings file for Ivy Projects.

[[IvyPlugin-Version1.6(Apr27,2010)]]
=== Version 1.6 (Apr 27, 2010)

* Fixed http://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-6308[JENKINS-6308] -
Ivy Project global ANT_OPTS are now saved properly.

[[IvyPlugin-Version1.5(Apr1,2010)]]
=== Version 1.5 (Apr 1, 2010)

* Fixed several issues with Ivy Project build dependencies for projects
configured to build their modules as separate jobs.
** a project can no longer run again until all its module builds have
finished (otherwise the svn changes get out of sync between module
builds)
** a project will no longer allow downstream projects of its modules to
build when their "Block build when upstream project is building" option
is selected. This is done by adding a virtual dependency between the
parent project and the downstream project that never actually triggers a
build, but makes the project show up in the transitive upstream
dependencies
** a project will now correctly set up its own modules' build
dependencies when "Build whenever an Ivy dependency is built" is
unchecked

[[IvyPlugin-Version1.4(Mar22,2010)]]
=== Version 1.4 (Mar 22, 2010)

* Fixed regression in 1.3 where the specified ant version is not
selected when job configuration page is opened.

[[IvyPlugin-Version1.3(Mar19,2010)]]
=== Version 1.3 (Mar 19, 2010)

* Fixed http://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-5961[JENKINS-5961] -
Relative paths to ant build files actually work now.
* Removed the need to have a specific Ant installation configured. If
none is now configured, no select box will be shown on the job
configuration page and Jenkins will just use the "ant" command on your
PATH (just like Freestyle projects do). Mentioned in
http://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-5961[JENKINS-5961].

[[IvyPlugin-Version1.2(Mar16,2010)]]
=== Version 1.2 (Mar 16, 2010)

* Fixed http://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-5823[JENKINS-5823] -
Ivy plugin will no longer throw a NullPointerException if you leave the
targets field blank.

[[IvyPlugin-Version1.1(Feb26,2010)]]
=== Version 1.1 (Feb 26, 2010)

* Made sure Ivy Modules can't be built when their parent is disabled
* Implemented incremental build functionality for aggregated builds
* Added option to disable ivy build triggers between Ivy Project jobs.
* *Note:* requires Jenkins 1.347 or newer

[[IvyPlugin-Version0.6(Jan19,2010)]]
=== Version 0.6 (Jan 19, 2010)

Downstream builds will no longer be triggered when the current build has
failed.
* *Note:* requires Jenkins 1.341 or newer

[[IvyPlugin-Version0.5(Jan18,2010)]]
=== Version 0.5 (Jan 18, 2010)

* Fixed NullPointerException introduced in 0.4 when no build with a
workspace can be found for an ivy-enabled project
