Agiletestware Pangolin TestRail Connector plugin integrates Jenkins with
TestRail by automatically publishing test results from Jenkins to
TestRail using Pangolin server (http://www.agiletestware.com/pangolin/).

integrate http://www.gurock.com/testrail/[TestRail] into their CI
workflow without writing a single line of
code.[.conf-macro .output-inline]##

----
pangolinTestRail([
     testRailProject: 'project',
     testRailUserName: 'user',
     testRailPassword: 'encrypted password',
        configs:[[
         testPath: 'Master\\Section1\\Section2',
