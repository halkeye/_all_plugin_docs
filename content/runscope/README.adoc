[.conf-macro .output-inline]#This plugin allows you to add a
https://www.runscope.com/[Runscope] API test as a build step into your
Jenkins build pipeline. The plugin will trigger a specific API test (via
https://www.runscope.com/docs/api-testing/integrations[Trigger URL]) and
wait for the test to complete. If the test passes, the build steps will
continue. However, if it fails, the build will be marked as failed.#
