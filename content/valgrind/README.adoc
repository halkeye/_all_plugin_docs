[.conf-macro .output-inline]##Integrates
http://www.valgrind.org/[Valgrind] in Jenkins.##This Plugin integrates
http://www.valgrind.org/[Valgrind] (memcheck to be exact) into Jenkins
by providing:

* Valgrind Runner: to run valgrind with your executables
* Valgrind Publisher: to record valgrind xml reports

Those two things work independently from each other. So if your build
system already calls valgrind (as part of your unit tests or whatever)
just use the publisher to record and analyze the xml reports.

Feedback, bug reports and feature requests are highly appreciated, just
create a JIRA issue or drop me a email.
