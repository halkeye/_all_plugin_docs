Stream iOS & Android builds directly within Jenkins via Appetize.io's
cloud-based iOS Simulators & Android Emulators.

This plugin adds a post-build step that uploads iOS and Android builds
to https://appetize.io/[https://appetize.io], a service that streams
cloud-based iOS Simulators and Android emulators in web browsers. On
success, users can run their builds directly in the Jenkins UI.
