`+{jenkins-plugin-info:cryptomove}+`Â 

The CrytpoMove Key Vault Jenkins plugin sources your keys and secrets
stored on CryptoMove and runs a command with your keys and secrets
available as environment variables with the name and value. +
 +
The plugin has three inputs:

* `command` - the command you want to run with your CryptoMove keys
sourced as environment variables.
* `token` - the authentication token from CryptoMove you want to use.
All of the keys that the token provides read access to will be sourced
as environment variables.
* `email` - the email of the CryptoMove user who owns the token
