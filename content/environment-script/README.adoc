Allows you to run a script before each build that generates environment
variables for it.

[[EnvironmentScriptPlugin-Description]]
== Description

Environment Script Plugin allows you to have a script run after SCM
checkout, before the build. If the script fails (exit code isn't zero),
the build is marked as failed. +
Any output on standard out is parsed as environment variables that are
applied to the build. It supports "override syntax" to append paths to
PATH-like variables (through
http://javadoc.jenkins-ci.org/hudson/EnvVars.html#override(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String)[EnvVars.override]
in Jenkins).

Some information about how it runs:

* It runs *after* SCM checkout, so you can refer to files from your SCM
of choice.
* Matrix builds are supported, and the script runs on each of the build
combinations (sub-builds, or whatever you call them), *not* on the
'master' flyweight task that kicks off the other ones.
* It supports "override" (through
http://javadoc.jenkins-ci.org/hudson/EnvVars.html#override(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String)[EnvVars.override])
syntax for appending to PATH-like variables:
`+PATH+myuniqueidentifier=/foo+` is the same as PATH=$PATH:/foo in
shell-script (notice the : is added automatically).
* If you want to fail a build from the script, just exit with status
code 1.
* Support unix and windows scripts.

[[EnvironmentScriptPlugin-Setup]]
=== Setup

To enable this plugin, go to the configuration page of the job you care
about, and check the box named
`+Generate environment variables from script+`.

[[EnvironmentScriptPlugin-Regularjob]]
==== Regular job

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/Screen_Shot_2012-08-06_at_4.55.12_PM.png[image]#

In your script, just print "FOO=bar" to the standard output to set that
variable.

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
echo VARIABLE1=Hello World
----

If you want to append to an existing PATH-style variable, you can do:

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
echo PATH+unique_identifier=/usr/local/bin
----

Otherwise, you're free to do whatever your heart desires in this script
- `+cat+` a file, run a script in some other language from your
project's source tree, etc.

[[EnvironmentScriptPlugin-Matrixjob]]
==== Matrix job

[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper]#image:docs/images/envscript_matrix.png[image]#

Matrix jobs are pretty much the same as regular jobs, except you get a
new checkbox: `+Run only on parent+`. If you enable this option, the
script will only run on the matrix "parent" job, and not on the
individual "configuration builds" (sub-builds). The environment
variables will still be propagated to the children.

This option comes in handy if you need to do something like generate a
shared version number based on a timestamp - the code will only run
once, but all the different configurations will get the variable. Here's
an example - note that *ONLY* $VERSION is seen by the jobs, not
$base_version and $unix_time.

[source,syntaxhighlighter-pre]
----
base_version=$(cat version.txt)
unix_time=$(date +%s)
echo VERSION=${base_version}-${unix_time}
