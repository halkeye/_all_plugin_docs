[[OracleCloudInfrastructureComputeClassicPlugin-Prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites

 

. You need to have a oracle cloud account, to sign up,
try https://cloud.oracle.com/en_US/tryit[Oracle Cloud]
. Your Jenkins server must be installed with JDK7 or higher

 

[[OracleCloudInfrastructureComputeClassicPlugin-Compatibility]]
== Compatibility

. The plugin is tested on minimum Jenkins version 1.625.3, they may not
work with versions early than 1.554.
. For Jenkins versions between 1.554 and 1.625, please make sure plugin
'bouncycastle API Plugin' has been pre-installed. This could be checked
at 'Manage Jenkins' -> 'Manage Plugins' -> 'Installed' list, and could
be found and installed from 'Available' list.

 

[[OracleCloudInfrastructureComputeClassicPlugin-Installation]]
== Installation

You can install or update the plugin through Jenkins update center or
manually. To install or update the plugin through Jenkins update center:
Go to your Jenkins console, click "Manage Jenkins" -> "Manage Plugins",
then search Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute Classic Plugin.

To manually install the plugin:

. Git clone the project and build with:
+
....
mvn package
....
. Go to your Jenkins console, click "Manage Jenkins" -> "Manage Plugins"
-> "Advanced" -> "Upload Plugin" -> Select
oracle-cloud-infrastructure-compute-classic.hpi file in target folder
under your project -> click "Upload"

 

[[OracleCloudInfrastructureComputeClassicPlugin-Configuration]]
== Configuration

[[OracleCloudInfrastructureComputeClassicPlugin-AddNewCloud]]
=== Add New Cloud

. From Jenkins server console, click "Manage Jenkins" -> "Configure
System"
. Click "Add a new cloud" and select "Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
Compute Classic"
. Enter credentials for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute Classic
account (Note you can repeat step 3 multiple times to add multiple
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute Classic accounts)
* Name: an identifier from Jenkins' perspective on this account, enter
anything you want
* REST Endpoint and Identity Domain: can be obtained from your Oracle
Cloud Infrastructure Compute Classic Service console
. Click "Test Connection" to verify that Jenkins can successfully talk
to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute Classic with the
account/credential you entered +
[.confluence-embedded-file-wrapper .confluence-embedded-manual-size]#image:docs/images/image2018-1-16_13:50:58.png[image,height=250]#
. Click "Advanced" and fill the number in "Instance Cap" field to limit
the maximum number of compute instances that are allowed to be created
using above account

 

[[OracleCloudInfrastructureComputeClassicPlugin-AddNewTemplate]]
=== Add New Template

. Click "Add" in "Instance Templates" section to add one resource
configuration set for desired compute instances, you can click "Add"
multiple times if you need different compute instance configurations.
. Input or select values in the 'Instance Template' section:
* Description: help other users/colleagues understand what this template
is used for
* Usage: it's recommended that you select "Only build jobs with label
expressions matching this node" for now
* Labels: unique identifier which allows Jenkins to pick the right
compute instance template to start
* Image List Source: allow user to select customized image besides image
provided in /oracle/public/ container by selecting "Private Image"
* Shape, Image List Source, Image List, Image List Entry, Storage Volume
Size: specify desired requirement on CPU, RAM, Image, Storage
size _[Important : Make sure Java is installed in selected image or
refer "Init Script" in Step 3 to install Java on the newly launched
compute instances]_
* Security List: make sure you have enabled security rule through Oracle
Cloud Infrastructure Compute Classic Service console to allow SSH access
* Remote FS root, Remote SSH user: dedicated directory for Jenkins agent
in slave node and the ssh user used for Jenkins master to access Jenkins
slave, make sure the SSH user has written permission on Remote FS root
directory
* SSH Public Key Name: user can select the ssh public key they already
uploaded to Oracle Cloud Compute Service
* SSH Private Key: user needs to put in corresponding private key that
allows jenkins connect to the compute instances provisioned using above
public key.
. Click "Verify SSH Key Pair" to verify the public key and private key
are matched or not as below. +

. Click "Advanced" for more configuration options:
* Orchestration Description:description for oplan orchestration of each
compute cloud instance. If unspecified, default value "Jenkins agent"
will be used. Refer Orchestrations v1 Templates for details info.
* Start Timeout Seconds: number of seconds to wait for new Oracle Cloud
Infrastructure Compute Classic instance to reach state "ready", default
value is 300. Refer Orchestrations v1 Life Cycle for details info.
* SSH Connection Timeout Seconds: number of seconds to wait for new
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute Classic instance from state "ready"
to be SSH connectable from Jenkins master, default value is 60.
* Idle Termination Minutes:number of minutes for Jenkins to wait before
deleting an idle slave, which means completely removal of the created
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute Classic instance. A value of 0 (or
an empty string) indicates that idle slaves should never be
stopped/deleted. As an example, let's say a slave was started at 11:00
and Idle Termination Minutes was set 5. The slave executed several
Jenkins jobs from 11:00 to 11:20, and has been idle since then. At 11:25
Jenkins finds the idle timeout of above slave has reached and the slave
will be deleted.
* Number of Executors: this controls the number of concurrent builds
that Jenkins can perform. So the value affects the overall system load
Jenkins may incur. A good value to start with would be the number of
processors on your system.
* Increasing this value beyond that would cause each build to take
longer, but it could increase the overall throughput, because it allows
CPU to build one project while another build is waiting for I/O.
* When using Jenkins in the master/slave mode, setting this value to 0
would prevent the master from doing any building on its own. Slaves may
not have zero executors, but may be temporarily disabled using the
button on the slave's status page.
* Init Script: Corresponds to "opc-init", user can define several lines
of shell based commands to configure the provisioned compute instances
(One-time) before the first Jenkins job starts to build; for example, if
the image user selected does not have Java pre-installed, user can input
Java installation command like "sudo yum -y install java"
* Init Script Timeout: Number of seconds to wait for the completion of
Init Script. Default value is 120 seconds. +

[[OracleCloudInfrastructureComputeClassicPlugin-Jobconfiguration]]
==== Job configuration

We have added an instance template with a specific label string, to
restrict projects can be run with this kind of template, user can simply
input the same label string in "Label Expression" field of the Jenkins
job configuration page.
