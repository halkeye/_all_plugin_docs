This plugin allows you to automatically abort a build if it's taking too
long. +

Once the timeout is reached, Jenkins behaves as if an invisible hand has
clicked the "abort build" button.

This plugin isn't applicable to pipelines. +
Use
https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/workflow-basic-steps/#code-timeout-code-enforce-time-limit[`+timeout+`
step in workflow-basic-steps] instead.

[[Build-timeoutPlugin-Instructions:]]
== Instructions:

After installing the plugin, go to the configure page for your job and
selectÂ "*Abort the build if it's stuck*".

[.aui-icon .aui-icon-small .aui-iconfont-warning .confluence-information-macro-icon]#
#

Because Java only allows threads to be interrupted at a set of fixed
locations, depending on how a build hangs, the abort operation might not
take effect. For example,

* if Jenkins is waiting for child processes to complete, it can abort
right away.
* if Jenkins is stuck in an infinite loop, it can never be aborted.
* if Jenkins is doing a network or file I/O within the Java VM (such as
lengthy file copy or SVN update), it cannot be aborted.

So if you think the build time out isn't taking effect, our default
assumption is that the build is hanging at the place that cannot be
interrupted. If you suspect otherwise, please
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Build+is+hanging[obtain the
thread dump] and report it.
