By default, Monitor Pro tries to connect to Jenkins
at http://localhost:8080/jenkins, if we have configured Jenkins on
another port or base path, we need to set the correct value in the
configuration menu. Remember that Monitor Pro runs on Jenkis, so it is
not to set any user or password. You only need to fill in these filds if
you run Monitor Pro on another web application or if you want monitoring
another jenkins server.
